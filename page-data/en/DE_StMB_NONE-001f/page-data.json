[...]\n[Sachs 1989, 7]\n\nThe Lives of Christ and the Virgin displayed on Sundays. When the inner wings are closed a screen displaying 32 panels is visible. These are brightly coloured and painted on a gold ground. The Live of Christ is illustrated with scenes each containing only a few figures. The Passion is shown in a central position on the reverse of the two wings that close the shrine and thrust forward by the depth of the shrine. Preceding events are shown on the outer wing panels to the left and right.\nWhen the second set of wings is closed the altarpiece displays a final screen consisting of series of almost square panels. The images seem more colourful because the medieval gold ground has been abandoned here. Generally only one saint is represented in a realistic landscape by either an event from his/her life or the martyrdom. On the altarpiece this third thematic cycle presents the most motifs if we include the Legend of St Nicholas that is always visible on the predella and the carved figures in the shrine and on the superstructure. The cult of the saints, which evolved out of the medieval belief in the intercession of the saints between God and Mankind, spread like the cult of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages.[...]. Written sources from the time of the Christian persecution by the Romans is the basis for the saints legends, which over the centuries were assumed by popular poetry, and frequently enriched by motifs from pagan myths.\n[Sachs 1989, 81-99]","year":1989},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Die Datierung des Bernauer Altars wird mit der Fertigstellung des Chorneubaus der Marienkirche 1519 in Zusammenhang gebracht,(Fußnote 1289) ein denkbares, wenngleich etwas spät anmutendes Datum.

Consequently at Agaunum on the Rhone (now Saint-Maurice) orders were given to have them beheaded. The panel depicts this bloodbath. Roman soldiers attack their Christian counterparts with swords, and although also armed the latter resign themselves to death and pray.\n\nSecond legend: A vision of Christ as the Man of Sorrows appeared to Pope Gregory and his two deacons while they were celebrating the Mass. He alighted from the tomb wearing the crown of thrones and displaying his stigmata. Behind him the tools of his Passion are visible: the cross, the ladder, the lance; the sponge and three nails. The three heads shown in a ring of cloud should also be read in this context: Judas with the money-bag around his neck, Herod wearing an oriental turban and Peter and the maid to whom he denied knowing Christ. The legend recounts that the pope and Church Father Gregory received a vision of Christ in the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome. The motif aquired great significance and was widely disseminated, in particular as folkloristic evidence for the presence of the body of Christ in the Eucharist.\n\nThird legend: St Clare is depicted as a nun wearing a black habit that conceals her neck and head. She holds a monstrance in her hands. She was the daughter of a noble family and became one of the first followers of St Francis. In 1212 as an eighteen year old she took her vows of poverty, chastity and obiedience. She founded a monastic female community the 'Second Order', which later became known as the Poor Clares. The precious monstrance in her hands is a late gothic piece worked in gold with decorative figures that reference an event in the saint¿s life. In about 1240 when plundering Saracens from Friedrich II's army threatened Assisi St Clare had herself brought to the gates of the monastery with the Holy Sacrament to ask for God's help. According to the legend the invaders who had already climbed over the monastery wall were so shocked that they beat a hasty retreat. The female saint standing opposite her, wearing modern secular clothes is probably Genevieve of Paris. Her attribute the candle has been misunderstood here. According to the legend she assisted against the 'Holy Fire' and on her way to church her candle was blown out by a devil and relit by an angel. \n\nFourth legend: Leonard was a Franconian nobleman, who supposedly lived at the court of the Merowingian king. The Golden Legend tells of his daily visits to the prisoners and recounts how he managed to convince King Chlodwig to liberate them. He turned down the diocese offered to him and instead chose to live as a hermit, curing cripples and helping the needy. Later he founded and became the abbot of Noblac monastery near Limoges. The panel depicts a young man with a tonsure already wearing a Benedictine habit and holding an abbatial staff. He opens the stocks himself to free the prisoners.\n\nFifth legend: Mark is depicted sitting at a lectern writing the gospel. As the bishop of Alexandria he wears a cope and mitre and as one of Peter's pupils he is represented as a young man. The lion, his symbol lies like a placid pet at his feet. The artist has created an image of a scholar in his small study similar to the many representations of St Jerome. This motif was particularly popular during the rise of humanism.\n\nSixth legend: Two small children are shown lying at the feet of a bishop who has raised his hand in blessing. A third child sleeps beside them, or perhaps he is also dead. The bishop who performed the miracle and is shown on the panel wearing vestments and holding a crosier cannot be clearly identified. It could be Valentine with the epileptic. He also cured a blind child, or Nicholas who raised three pickled boys from the dead. \n\nSeventh legend: According to the legend an eagle protected Servatius, the bishop of Tongeren from the rays of the sun while he slept. The panel shows a sumptuously dressed young woman in front of the bishop with lizards climbing up her dress. She appeared to him in a dream and could be interpreted as the personification of heresy as Servatius contested the hererdoxy of the Arians, an act that was also equated with vanquishing the dragon.\n\nEighth legend: Paul of Thebes was the first Christian hermit. The son of rich parents he fled from Christian persecution into the mountains. There he spent his entire life in a cave without ever receiving anybody. However, shortly before his death he was visited by St Anthony, also a hermit, who lived first in a ruin on the Nile and then in the desert [...]. The panel shows Anthony wearing the habit of the order named after him exhibiting a T-shaped cross. The two old men are shown with rosary beads and a book lost in contemplation. The raven that supplied Paul in the desert brings them nourishment. \n[Sachs 1989,  81, 111-113]","dimensions":"Dimensions of upper support: 129.5 x 115 cm \nDimensions of lower support: 129 x 115 cm
