The bearded man is shown facing right, wearing a red beret and a red and white striped cloak with slashed sleeves tied together with bands. He has two chains with rings around his neck. His hands are folded in front of his stomach (only his thumbs are visible). There appears to be a slight similarity with a portrait of Heinrich Aldegrever. The painting was assumed to be from the Cranach workshop, but it is more likely that it was created in the late 18th century.\n[Kulturstiftung Dessau Wörlitz; http://www.museum-digital.de/san/index.php?t=objekt&oges=36115; accessed 7 April 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 66.5 x 53.5 cm\n[Kulturstiftung Dessau Wörlitz; http://www.museum-digital.de/san/index.php?t=objekt&oges=36115; accessed 7 April 2015]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3414,"height":4716}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":297},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":594},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":890},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2622,"height":3891},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":276},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":553},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":829},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3414,"height":4716},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B/01_Overall/DE_KsDW_I-57_FR353B_2014_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_KsDW_I-57","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Kulturstiftung Dessau Wörlitz; http://www.museum-digital.de/san/index.php?t=objekt&oges=36115; accessed 7 April 2015]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Follower of Lucas Cranach the Elder"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Melzer, in Exhib.
