He is shown in three-quarter profile facing right and has been shifted slightly to the left, off the central axis of the panel. Luther wears a black gown with high collar over a black tunic, which has a red ribbon at the neck and reveals the black fringed collar of a white shirt. Luther's plump facial features are characterized by a five o'clock shadow; his short curly hair oscillates between dark and light shades of grey. \n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 64.8 x 48.9 cm (25 1/2 x 19 1/4 in.)\nDimensions including frame: 92.3 x 78 cm (36 5/16 x 30 11/16 in.)\n[Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, revised 2015]","exhibitionHistory":"- Cambridge, Mass. 1971\n- Cambridge, Mass. 1992/1993\n- Cambridge, Mass. 1994/1995","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3000,"height":3911}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":261},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E/01_Overall/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E_2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":521},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E/01_Overall/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E_2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":782},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E/01_Overall/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E_2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3000,"height":3911},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E/01_Overall/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E_2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E/01_Overall/US_HAM_1955-164_FR423E_2014_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- at the top:\n'D.
