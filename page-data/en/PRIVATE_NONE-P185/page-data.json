Her arms are crossed and she is seated facing slightly left. [...] The sitter is most likely Margaret of Anhalt, (b.1387) the second wife of John the Constant (1468 - 1532) who was brother of Saxon Elector Frederick the Wise (1463 - 1525). John married Margaret, the daughter of Prince Waldemar VI of Anhalt, in 1513 after the death of his first wife, Sophie of Mecklenburg. \nThe last numeral on the inscription of the year on the painting reads '1526'. Margaret of Anhalt died in 1521. There is a directly comparable inscription on Cranach's 1526 portrait of Martin Luther.\n[Private Collection, revised 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:  47.8 x 35.6 cm\n[Private Collection,

XRF analysis confirmed the presence of tin in the yellow areas throughout the painting including the sleeves.\n\nExamination confirmed the authenticity of the signature on the far-right side of the painting, which was revealed after the latest restoration of the work in 2008. The craquelure patterns over the entire painting have also affected this area, at least indicating that the inscription is very old. Furthermore not only does it bear comparison to other contemporary signatures from the workshop, but a detail of the X-radiograph shows the use of an X-ray absorbent pigment. This together with evidence from XRF analysis suggest the presence of a lead containing pigment, in this case, lead tin yellow, a pigment commonly used in the Cranach workshop. \n\nThe x-radiograph also shows that the technique employed for modeling the face is closely similar to that of the ‘Portrait of Princess Sibylle of Cleve’, 1526 (Weimar, DE_KSW_G12) and other portraits of this period. \n\nA comparison with other works painted around 1526 shows similar treatment of the chains, all painted with a clear distinguishing shape and style that match the Portrait of a Lady [US_MIA_57-10; FIN_FNG_AI316; PRIVATE_NONE-P152; RU_ESP_GE683; PL_WPM_Wil1518; DE_KSVC_M163; PRIVATE_NONE-P131; DE_SPSG_GKI30187; US_MFAH-SCBFH-1979-2 etc.]\n\nTechnical examination and historical research confirmed the attribution of the painting to Lucas Cranach the Elder. The materials and techniques used for the portrait are closely similar to those identified in previous technical studies of works by the artist, and incorporate the characteristic materials and working methods of his workshop. Evidence suggests that the portrait was painted in 1526, an assessment that is confirmed by the presence of an original date and inscription. The embroidered ‘H’ on the sitter’s headdress and the inscribed date preclude an earlier hypothesis identifying the sitter as Margaret of Anhalt. In order to solidify the argument for 1526, further research to identify the sitter is required. Betrothal portraits marked the occasion of a wedding, thus knowing when the sitter was married would potentially bring clarity to the date of this painting’s creation. The paintings object biography needs to be explored to ascertain whether it had a companion piece, as betrothal paintings were commonly paired."}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["03_IRR/PRIVATE_NONE-P185_FR-none_2019_IRR.tif"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Mirra Berridge","role":"photographed by"},{"name":"Christine Wilda","role":"photographed by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2019","endDate":"2019"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"19.
