The subject and motif as well as the date, horizontal format and dimensions link the panel with two other paintings: one shows a lusting old man being made drunk by two women and stolen from (FR291), while the other one painted by Lucas Cranach the Younger and now in Dresden shows two ill-matched pairs, respectively with an old man and an old woman as well as a young pair (FR292). The panel that is representative of Cranach’s creative diversification of established subjects could be one of the two documented ‚Buhlschaften‘ (illicit relationship) as having been in Hartenfels castle in Torgau. It is also conceivable that it was part of a ‘Weibermacht’ (Power of Women) series as has been suggested for the Dresden painting. [Carrasco, Exhib. Cat.
