Four arrows have already pierced his body. A crossbow man and an archer at the right edge of the picture aim at the saint and are about to shoot further arrows. Another crossbowman in the foreground is preparing to draw his bow. A group of men, amongst them soldiers, watch the event. They are set against the backdrop of a landscape with a view of a castle on a rocky outcrop and are circumscribed by bushes and trees. \n\n[GÃ¶rres, cda 2013]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:
