His earliest painted rendition of the theme is the work of circa 1512-14 in Fort Worth [US_KAMFW_AP2004-03], in which the two male protagonists are dressed the same as in the present work, but are positioned somewhat differently. The principal version of this panel is in the Seattle Art Museum [US_SAM_52-38]. There are some minor differences between the two works, largely confined to the background, and in particular to the hilltop castle and to the branches in the upper left. The Seattle version aside, Friedländer lists a further ten treatments of the subject, variously attributed to the elder and younger Cranach.[1] Cranach the Elder's earliest treatment of the subject is a woodcut from 1508 [2]. \n[1] Friedländer, op. cit., nos. 252-258, 409, 409a, 409b.\n[2] See Hollstein, vol.
