They are shown standing against a black background on a narrow strip of ground with the tree of knowledge between them. The serpent slithers out of the crown of the tree down the trunk with its head stretched out towards Eve. She looks at the viewer, while holding the treacherous apple against her cheek. Her pale skin is distinguished from the darker skin tone of Adam who has raised his curly head and appears to look up.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 30.8 x 23.3 cm\n[D.
