Venus looks out at the viewer and points with her right hand to her son, Cupid. He has stolen a honeycomb from a knothole in the tree at the left edge of the painting and as a consequence is being attacked by bees. However, Cupid seems by and large undisturbed by this and tastes the honey with a finger.\n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50 x 33 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 400]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1380,"height":2101}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":304},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":609},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":913},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1380,"height":2101},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- text block at the top left : (the text is almost illegible, but by comparison with other versions of the same subject by Cranach it can be reconstructed as follows: \n'DVM PVER ALVEOLO FVRATVR MELLA CVPIDO / FVRANTI DIGITVM SEDVLA PVNXIT APIS / SIC ETIAM NOBIS BREVIS ET MORITVRA VOLVPTAS / QVAM PETIMVS TRISTI MIXTA DOLORE NOCET'\n[cda 2016]","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P156","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 400]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 400]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 50 x 33 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 400]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1540","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P156","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P156_FR400_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Venus and Cupid, stealing Honey"},"objectId":840144,"objectName":"FR400","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- New York, Thomas I.
