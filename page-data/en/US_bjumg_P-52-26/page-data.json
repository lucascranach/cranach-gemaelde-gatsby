While the image appears morbid to many, one author has pointed out that beheadings like this are frequently seen in Cranach's oeuvre. A young girl in a lavish red dress with gold trimming stands against a stark black background. Ornate gold necklaces hang from her neck, and on her left index finger, a ring peeks through intricate slashed gloves. Her face has a smug expression as she holds a platter on which rests a man's severed head. As is often the case with the Old Masters, Cranach did not paint Salome in traditional Middle Eastern clothing, with which he would have been unfamiliar. Instead, he painted her as a contemporary German noblewoman, giving us a glimpse of the beautiful clothing of the time period.\n[Bob Jones University Museum & Gallery, revised 2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 56.8 x 34.3 cm\nDimensioins including frame: 72.7 x 50.3 x 5.1 cm\n[Bob Jones University Museum & Gallery, revised 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"Treasure Island, San Francisco 1939\nBirmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, AL, USA 1952\nHigh Museum of Art - Atlanta, GA USA 1953\nNew Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans, LA, USA 1953\nGeorge Thomas Hunter Gallery of Art, Chattanooga, TN USA 1953\nE. and A.
