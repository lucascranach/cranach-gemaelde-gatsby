The panel has no knots or tool tracks.\nIn 1958 the panel was treated for wood worm attacks in the upper part of the painting by the cabinetmaker Topp. The panel was on that occasion planed to the current 5 mm thickness and impregnated with Damar and wax. The wax has filled out lots of the holes from the wood worm attack.\nThe back of the panel is reinforced with a layer of gauze, which is not covering the joint of the planks.\nThe joint of the planks is reinforced on the front of the painting with fibre material, which is visible in x-ray. The fibre material is not visible on the front of the painting.\nOn top of the joint of the two planks the wood is further planed to 3 mm. The joint is reinforced with eight mahogany pieces of wood (each 3 x 1.5 cm) which are glued across the joint to the back. Across these wooden pieces, eight other pieces of mahogany are glued on (each 5 x 1.5 cm).\nThe lower edge of the back of the panel is reinforced with a piece of wood (approx. 3.5 cm wide).\nThere are small residues of paint at the back of the panel, maybe from a mixture of white lead that were used to treat the wood worm attack.\nThe ground goes right to the edge of the painting on the upper edge, which isn't the case of the three other sides of the painting. This indicates that the painting was originally higher than the current format.\n\n[Mette Kokkenborg, Statens Museum for Kunst, 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2013","endDate":"2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"04.
