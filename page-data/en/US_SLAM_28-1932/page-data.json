On the right side stand three female figures.The one farthest right stands with her back to the viewer but her head turned to look out. She wears three gold chains around her neck and her hair is bound. She clutches a diaphanous scarf with her left hand. The middle female tilts her head to the left. She wears a choker and a longer gold chain that hangs down between her breasts. Her blond hair falls down to her shoulders and she wears a narrow black band on her head. She crosses both arms before her stomach and the diaphanous veil falls across her left forearm and hands in front of her abdomen and thighs.The third young woman stands facing the viewer with her head turned to the left. She holds the edge of the diaphanous veil against her left thigh and her right hand rests upon a metal orb that is held for her by a bearded old man who wears a fantastic costume of peacock feathers. The young woman wears a red hat over her bound blond tresses and she also wears a choker and\none necklace. The veil hangs in front of her lower torso and rests in the crook of her right elbow. At the far right sits a young, bearded man wearing red and gold armor. His helmet rests on a small hillock to his left on which he places his open hand. Behind his head rises a tree with foliage at the top. In front of the foliage flies a small cupid, taking aim with his arrow that is directed toward the young woman wearing the red hat. To the left of the tree is the arched neck and head of a white horse. In the right background is a rocky outcropping, with vegetation and architectural remnants. In the center distance rises a low mountain; to its left\ncan be discerned a tower.\n\n[St. Louis Art Museum, revised 2012]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50.8 x 36.4 cm (20 x 14 5/16 in.)\n[St. Louis Art Museum, revised 2012]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3515,"height":4986}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":284},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/01_Overall/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2009-09_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":567},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/01_Overall/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2009-09_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":851},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/01_Overall/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2009-09_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3515,"height":4986},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/01_Overall/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2009-09_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/01_Overall/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2009-09_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2694,"height":3720}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":276},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/05_UV-light/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2011-06_UV-light-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":552},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/05_UV-light/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2011-06_UV-light-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":829},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/05_UV-light/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2011-06_UV-light-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2694,"height":3720},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/05_UV-light/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2011-06_UV-light-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258/05_UV-light/US_SLAM_28-1932_FR258_2011-06_UV-light.dzi"}}]},"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_SLAM_28-1932","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[St. Louis Art Museum, revised 2012]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"Reverse of the panel/cradle:\n- on verso:\nin red paint: '28:32'\n- on verso, on cradling cross bar:\n in red paint: '28:32'\n- on verso, on cradling:\n on paper label, in ink: 'Bt 1054'\n\nReverse of the frame:\n- on verso, on frame:\n on paper label, printed: 'Arnold Wiggins & Sons / Limited / Nos. 30-34\nWoodfield Place, Harrow Road / London W9 2BJ / Telephone: 071-286 9656 / [on left with Royal coat-of-arms] 'By appointment / to H.M.
