In the central shrine beneath a delicate baldachin of foliage the life-sized carved figure of St Nicholas with a crozier and  the three pieces of gold on his book stands in the centre, on his left (from the viewer’s perspective) is St Leonhard with a crozier and a chain, and on the right St Wenzel in armour with a spear and shield. The frame is covered with foliage and two holy stand on each side figures representing the four Church Fathers: left Jerome and Augustine, right Gregory the Great and Ambrosius.\nThe wings are constructed in a similar manner: At the bottom quarter elegant columns carry an arched architectural element consisting of two segmental arches, within which the evangelists sit with their attributes at desks: left the evangelist John with the eagle and Matthew with the angel, right Mark with the lion and Luke with the bull.  Above this beneath an artistic open worked frame are on the left the carved figure of the evangelist John (chalice of poison) and St Florian (armour and banner) as well as on the right Mary Magdalene (ointment jar) and St Barbara (tower). In the richly carved predella beneath a double arch there is a relief depicting the Death of the Virgin. Flanking the predella are the electoral coats of arms and the Döbeln city coat of arms with the three towers. Until 1885 beneath this or on the mensa there was a further predella with a representation of the Last Supper. \n[http://www.kirchgemeinde-doebeln.de/index.php/nicolai/altar; accessed 11 Aug 2015]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1510,"dated":"about 1515 - 1516","end":1521,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Sandner 1993, 53]"},"description":"The recto depicts St Erasmus wearing vestments as a full-length figure. In his left hand he holds his intestines wrapped around a spindle as a symbol of his martyrdom. Beyond a low wall behind him there is a view of an expansive landscape. The image has a half-rounded top above which are ornamental tendrils. Emulating the carved figures in the central shrine the artist represents the figure like a statue standing on a podest. Similar depictions of two popes as well as St Valentine belong to the iconographic program of the first opening state. \n\nThe verso of the wing panel shows two scenes from the Life of St Nicholas. These belong to a series of four episodes from the Act of the Saint, that together with four other illustrations of the Life of another archetype of faith are visible when the altarpiece is closed. In the upper field the saint throws lumps of gold through the window of a father to save his daughter from prostitution. The father is visible listening at the door, as is the sleeping daughter. The lower field shows St Nicholas on the high seas. He has commanded that barrels of oil intended for an advanced payment, which were transported under a false pretext be thrown into the sea. Blazing flames betray the danger posed by the barrels. \n \n[cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support including frame: 282 x 116.8 cm\n[cda
