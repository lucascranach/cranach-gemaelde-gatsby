I assume Friedländer is referring here to the first edition of his Cranach catalogue published in 1932. The note by Friedländer is dated 26 January 1934. This is the b/w photograph from the Friedländer Archive. When Mrs. Cummer bought the painting in 1956, the Christ showed one finger [as seen in the b/w photograph]\nWhen the Cummer painting was restored in 1960, the conservator observed how the painting had been previously cleaned and restored. The conservator believed that the original painting by Cranach showed Christ pointing two fingers. This hypothesis can be supported by the fact that the version which went for sale at Lempertz in 1973 does indeed show 2 fingers. The conservator therefore reverted the \"one finger Child\" to an original \"two figure Child\". He also mentioned that other areas had been retouched, for example, the staff.\nConclusion: Friedländer 111 is indeed the Cummer Museum painting, only reproduced in a different conservation state. The dimensions are the same. The photograph in Friedländer's 1978 book, and the one reproduced from the Friedländer Archive, simply shows how the painting looked in the 1930's. \n[Nelda Damiano, Cummer Museum, e-mail correspondance 2017]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1513,"dated":"about 1518 - 1520","end":1525,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Cummer Museum, revised 2017] [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 111]"},"description":"This painting depicts the legend of St. Christopher, which records a Canaanite of huge stature named Offero who wanted to serve the most powerful person in the land. His first master, a king, failed him by fleeing in fear of Satan. The giant Offero left this king. During his wanderings in search of the all-powerful Christ, the giant came upon a hermit who directed him to ferry poor and weak people across a swollen stream. One night the giant Offero carried a small child. This small child grew heavier and heavier with each step. With the aid of a large branch the two reached the opposite shore where the giant explained how he felt like he was carrying the weight of the world. The child explained, yes. You were indeed carrying the weight of the world as well as the weight of the creator of the world. Offero was later given the name Christopher; which is Greek for \"Christ-bearer.\"\n[Cummer Museum, revised 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 58 x 39 cm\nDimensions including frame: 73.3 x
