He holds a lance in his right hand and in his left hand he presents the Austrian coat-of-arms (on which the fifth eagle is missing). \nThe saints, that were conceived together, stand on stony ground against a blue background.  The uniform background and the inscriptions indicate that the paintings are pendants, and that they perhaps served as the inner wings of a small altarpiece, which no longer exists. \n \nIconography: Margrave Leopold II. of Babenberg (1073-1136) was canonised thanks to the intervention of Emperor Friedrich III. in the year 1485.  The regional implication is substantially limited to Vienna and Lower Austria. Emperor Maximilian, who had the saint’s remains transferred, also had St Leopold portrayed as one of his ancestors in the “Ehrenpforte”. This pictorial type coined by Dürer can already be found in the woodcut ‘The Patron Saints of Austria’: as an old man with a beard, a ducal hat, in full regalia with the eagle emblem, many precious stones, a scepter and an ermine coat, on the right a shield combines the red-white-red Bindenschild (Babenberg coat-of-arms) and Lower Austrian coat-of-arms (Lerchenwappen (Larch coat-of-arms)).[1] The St Leopold by Cranach is orientated towards the widely disseminated figural type by Dürer of an older but powerful ruler with a curly beard and hair. Usually clad in an ermine cloak and with a ducal hat he is easily identifiable as a ruler, whereas in Cranach’s little painting St Leopold appears more atypical and can ultimately only be identified on the basis of the inscription and the coat-of-arms.\n \nResearch History: The small images of the saints from the clerical treasury have been a permanent fixture in the first room of the Early German School since the earliest installation of the Imperial Picture Gallery in the Belvedere.[2] The clearly legible characters of the signature and the date were already observed by Schuchardt and were taken as a point of reference for further research: he noted an orientation towards Dürer, which may be accounted for by the cooperation on the drawings in the margin of Emperor Maximilian’s prayer book in the same year.[3] Hereafter it was repeatedly pointed out that early dated paintings by Cranach, like the ones discussed here, are rare.[4] The catalogue entry from 1928 suspects, with reference to the concurrent work for Emperor Maximilian’s prayer book, that the winged altarpiece was commissioned by an Austrian because of the depiction of St Leopold.[5] Schade suggests that it could have been a present from Friedrich the Wise to Emperor Maximilian. He refers to a representation of a silver statue of St Jerome in the Wittenberg Heiltumsbuch from 1509 as an exemplary depiction of the saint: inverted but the position of the lion is identical.[6] The representation of St Leopold was evidently not among Cranach’s repertoire of forms as was observed in the catalogue of the Lower Austrian Landesausstellung from 1983: the ducal hat and the cloak differ from the prevaling depictions of the saint at that time.[7] \nWhereas the gallery catalogue from 1928 and later publications by the museum classify the panels as ‚autographic‘ paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Schade remarked that they were less meticulously executed panels from the Cranach workshop.[8]\n \nDiscussion:\nBoth panels have been preserved in their original size but the original frame was lost at some unknown date. On the panels there is no indication of the original assembly and consequently the designated use. The reverse of both panels exhibit a very old possibly original black coating. This side was presumably not intended for viewing, as it would otherwise feature marbling or some other embellishment. Therefore it remains open whether the panels served as wings of a small altar or whether they had another function.\n[Tüchler, Hoppe-Harnoncourt, Kunsthistorisches Museum, 2013][Translation, Smith, cda 2013]\n\n\n\n\n[1] Schoch, Rainer; Mende, Matthias; Scherbaum, Anna, et al.

It is apparent that there is a more extensive application of the blue background paint at the upper section of the lance above the hand and this begs the question whether a shorter lance was planed at an earlier stage of the creative process. The vertical contours of the lance were incised in the dry blue paint of the background as a construction aid (Fig. 003).\n\nThe flesh paint was modeled with a few impasto details over a semi-transparent base tone, allowing the ground to participate in the visual effect.  Occasionally the ground has not been covered with paint in the spaces in between or is visible through the thinly applied flesh paint (Fig. 004). White highlights were applied with visible brushstrokes to the flesh paint once dry, the contours of the facial features like the nostrils and bridge of the nose and the fingers were drawn in a diluted not very opaque brown paint (Fig. 005).\nThe impasto highlights were generally applied last, in the area of the pommel, sections where yellow highlights were smudged with the brown paint of the fur, suggest that evidently not much value was placed on strictly observing the sequence. \nCranach’s rapid painting technique can be seen in the areas applied wet-in-wet like for example the crossing hairs in the beard. \nIn the area of the cap the effect of the fur-trimming was achieved by dabbing white paint over a grey layer and then partially removing the wet paint with a brush to reveal the layer beneath in a sgraffito-like method (Fig. 006). A sgraffito-technique was also employed for the armor (Fig. 007). The halo is not gilded, but instead executed in yellow paint (008). \nThe saint’s red robe is built up as follows: a white layer was applied over a red and black layer and finally a red lake glaze was applied, which is in part mixed with black[1] (Fig. 009).\nThe designation of the saint as well as the date and signature (a serpent with elevated wings facing left) were applied at the top right edge in thick yellow paint.\n\n\n\n\n[1] See also Gunnar Heydenreich, Lucas Cranach the Elder- Painting materials, techniques and workshop practice, Amsterdam University Press, 2007, p.183"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"new frame\n[Tüchler, Kunsthistorisches Museum, 2013]\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The infrared reflectogram of both paintings reveals diluted, fluid underdrawing lines executed with a lively brush – mainly for the contours. Short, distinct lines sketch the facial features like eyebrows, ear and single curls in the beard. The underdrawing appears to be a very free indication rather than a meticulous designation as the painted version exhibits some deviations from the underdrawing. For example the lines in the area of the lance go beyond the shape and there are also marginal deviations in the painted version of the hilt of the sword in compared to the indications apparent in the underdrawing (Abb. 002).
