Bodmann from Mainz thought he recognized Albrecht’s lover, who he called Rehdingerin, in the pendant figure of St Ursula. This was a combination frequently chosen by Albrecht for other altarpieces. Out of this hypothesis there developed a persistent legend concerning one Ursula Rehdinger (variant forms of spelling), who was purported to be Albrecht’s concubine. This was relegated to the realm of myth by Kerstin Merkel. However, it is conceivable to interpret the figure as a historical person, namely Albrecht’s partner, Leys Schütz. This assumption is supported by a small diptych showing Albrecht as St Erasmus [...] Once again the antitype shows St Ursula, who in this painting wears a neckband with an inscription, which underlines the close relationship between both sitters.
