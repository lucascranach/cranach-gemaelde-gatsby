The wooden construction, which is 1.20 m in height, is mounted on a solid projecting stone at a height of c. 2.20 m. The left side of the pulpit with the entrance is shaped like a semi-circle whereas the right side with the lectern is rectangular. \nThe pulpit is decorated with six illustrations of the Life of the Virgin as well as the Life and Passion of Christ. Each scene is separated by a carved pilaster showing Hermes. \nAbove the paintings there is a carved frieze, 34 cm in height, depicting putti in tunics recalling Roman legionary uniforms alternating with different coats-of-arms. In the background green tendrils with predominantly red fruit have been painted behind the carving. There is a wooden base of 14 cm in height with a carved geometric decoration beneath the paintings, which finishes with a profiled batten. Above the pulpit is an abat-voix, which is decorated on the underside with a depiction of the Trinity on a gilded ground. This depiction is surrounded by angels on a blue background, holding the instruments of martyrdom. The painting is framed by a carved egg and dart ornamentation. The top of the abat-voix is decorated with a crown.\nThe six pulpit paintings illustrate - from left to right - the following subjects:\nThe Annunciation, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Baptism of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection. The lectern is located above the Crucifixion. \n \n[Herrschaft 2013, 18-19]","year":2013},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Iconography:\nAll four gospels report on the baptism of Christ by St John the Baptist in the Jordan. During this event God pledged himself to Jesus whereby the Holy Ghost descended as a dove and a heavenly voice spoke 'this is my beloved Son, whom I care for' (Mt. 3,17). Although the baptism has been depicted since early Christianity Lucas Cranach the Younger reinvented the scene by letting it take place in the presence of noble people and important reformers. This innovation made the subject of Christ's baptism one of the most important confessional images for the protestant faith.[1]   \nThe most noted painting of this subject is the painting owned by the Preußischen Schlösser und Gärten (Jagdschloss Grunewald)  from 1556. In this painting the baptism is attended by Johann von Anhalt and his brothers Georg and Joachim, Johann von Küstrin and his sister Margarete as well as the reformers Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon and also Lucas Cranach the Elder.[2] \nIn the Augustusburg pulpit painting created 17 years later in addition to the noble people - Elector August and his wife Anna and presumably his brother Moritz - no reformers are depicted but rather prophets from the old testament. The prophet Daniel as patron of the miners can be understood as an allusion to Elector August's great interest in mining. The prophet standing next to him with a white beard and red ermine trimmed robe cannot be identified, but was often depicted beside Moses in the so-called 'Law and Mercy' panels. Examples mentioned are the Allegory of Law and Mercy in the Germanischen Nationalmuseum (after 1529) and the Museen der Klassik Stiftung Weimar (about 1535 – 1540). \n[Herrschaft 2013, 26 – 27]\n\n\n\n\n[1] Ausst.

The lines were carried out in a dry drawing material, possibly a grey/black chalk. The sketchy underdrawing is executed with delicate lines. The arcs and wiggly and zig-zag forms bear witness to a lively, almost nervous drawing technique. The underdrawing is only partially binding. This applies mainly to the contours, which were often repeatedly drawn (e.g. Christ's left elbow). On the other hand the economic indication of inner forms are less binding, as shown by the arrangement of the folds in most of the garments. In the background the town and the castles are only vaguely indicated, likewise trees were only indicated with a few curved lines. Numerous formal clarifications were carried out during the painting process. To a limited exent this applies to the garments and the background already mentioned above. The position of St John the Baptist's leg is completely different from the underdrawing. The correction did not occur in the underdrawing but rather during the painting process. In the group of figures on the right edge of the painting some lines from the underdrawing, which were not covered by paint, are visible to the naked eye. The artist forgot to execute the prophet Daniel's headdress in paint, leaving the underdrawing visible. On the man behind the prophets the paint layer ends on the underdrawing line of the hatrim. This gives the impression that the artist intentionally left the dark line visible as a contour. \nIt is hard to image that the painting was completed on the basis of this underdrawing and without reference to a pre-existing design or a prototype. \n \n[Herrschaft 2013, 41, 43]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The paint layers probably consist of pigments bound in oil (a test for protein proved negative). On all the panels the paint layers extend to the edge at the sides - like the ground - whereas the paint layers at the top and bottom end before the ground.  \nBy and large all the panels exhibit a very economic painting technique with a thin application of paint, which nevertheless is predominantly opaque. In addition there are areas of glazed colour, where the imprimatura is occasionally visible and influences the colour scheme of the panel. \nThe quality of the painting is very mixed and reveals the cooperation of more than one person on each panel. Many of the affectionately executed details are only visible close up, which considering the position of the panels 2 meters above is never possible. Other areas are less precise and occasionally unfinished (this is also the case for the decorative painting on the pulpit).\n \nOf the six pulpit paintings the Baptism is of the highest painterly quality. The figures of Jesus, St John, God the Father and the electoral pair are very delicate and executed with great attention to detail, likewise the faces of both prophets on the right edge. \nThe electoral pair is dressed in floor-length gowns, which were initially painted in grey. The folds were modelled in a lighter grey and a floral ornamentation was then added in delicate black lines to create the effect of velvet. St John's fur robe was created by painting the folds in flesh coloured brushstrokes over a greyish brown ground. Fur is only painted along the hem with pale and dark brushstrokes. This suggests that St John wears his robe with the leather side turned outwards. \nThe faces of Jesus and St John were painted very softly with barely any brushstrokes visible. There are no contour lines. Volume was created by the soft transitions from the brown paint in the shadows to light grey mid-tones and flesh tones for the light areas and highlights. The latter was occasionally applied more thickly and some brushstrokes are visible. The eyes of both are brown with white points of light or - dashes. Black was only employed for the pupils and a short stroke for the eyelids, which is confined to above the pupil. Delicate strokes were employed to paint the hairs of St John's eyebrows and eyelashes, but not for Jesus. The execution of the bodies observes the same principles employed in the faces. In addition to the brown paint used to describe forms and for the shadow, grey paint was applied for the midtones and a flesh tone for the lighter areas. For this purpose the paint was no longer applied in discrete glazed layers, but rather juxtaposed with blurred transitions, so that the imprimatura could augment the luminosity of the flesh paint in the light areas. The faces of the electoral pair and prophets are executed in the same way. \nThe headdress of the prophet Daniel has a fur-trimming. The imitation of fur was achieved by employing short brown brushstrokes. The ground is visible on rest of the headdress as no further paint appplication occurred. The man between the two prophets wears a hat with a broad, upturned rim finished with a red glaze with yellow highlights. \n[Herrschaft 2013, 52 – 55]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["05_UV-light/DE_SKAU_NONE-SKAU002C_2013-05_UV-light.tif"],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"05. 2013","endDate":"05. 2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"13.
