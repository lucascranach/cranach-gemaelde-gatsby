In 1536 he married Apollonia Günterode, who died in 1557. The women clothed in black with portrait-like features could be identified as the two wives. The one on the left, shown in profile, was probably added to the composition later, which explains her rather cramped position. Accordingly this could be Apollonia, who died in 1557, the year when the painting was created. The young boy in the foreground and the infant presented to Jesus on a black cloth could be Cruciger’s deceased sons.     \nCruciger had two sons and one daughter from his first marriage and one son and three daughters from his second. Drees presumes that the four young women depicted with infants represent his daughters and that the youngest boy at top left is his third son Caspar Cruciger the Younger. \nThe panel may originally have been intended for the parish church of Wittenberg where Cruciger was buried in 1548.\nThe subject of 'Christ Blessing the Children' was not known before the Reformation. It can be interpreted as a reaction to the Anabaptists' rejection of the baptism of children. Luther invoked the quoted biblical text Mk 10 as justification.\nIn the Cranach workshop numerous paintings were created illustrating this subject, whereby no two are identical. One of these paintings was once also in the ducal collection in Gottorf palace (now in Copenhagen, FR362F): it arrived there as part of a dowery from the Saxon Princess Maria Elizabeth who married Duke Friedrich III of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorf in 1630.\nThe present panel can be distinguished from other depictions of the same subject by on the one hand the addition of the donors and on the other hand the material of the support, which is copper. It is one of the earliest known examples of painting on copper in Germany. \n[Daria Dittmeyer, Schloss Gottorf 2013]","year":2013}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1550,"dated":"about 1560","end":1565,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Schloss Gottorf, revised 2013]"},"description":"Christ is depicted in three-quarter profile facing to his left and standing in the centre of a half-length figural group.

The donors are positioned on his right and left: a man, his deceased first wife and his son wearing a shroud as well as presumably his second wife. The donor touches the right arm of Jesus. On the right side of the painting there are three mothers with infants, one of them breast feeding. On the left half of the painting another mother and child is shown in the background.
