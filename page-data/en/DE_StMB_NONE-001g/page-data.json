[...]\n[Sachs 1989, 7]\n\nThe Lives of Christ and the Virgin displayed on Sundays. When the inner wings are closed a screen displaying 32 panels is visible. These are brightly coloured and painted on a gold ground. The Live of Christ is illustrated with scenes each containing only a few figures. The Passion is shown in a central position on the reverse of the two wings that close the shrine and thrust forward by the depth of the shrine. Preceding events are shown on the outer wing panels to the left and right.\nWhen the second set of wings is closed the altarpiece displays a final screen consisting of series of almost square panels. The images seem more colourful because the medieval gold ground has been abandoned here. Generally only one saint is represented in a realistic landscape by either an event from his/her life or the martyrdom. On the altarpiece this third thematic cycle presents the most motifs if we include the Legend of St Nicholas that is always visible on the predella and the carved figures in the shrine and on the superstructure. The cult of the saints, which evolved out of the medieval belief in the intercession of the saints between God and Mankind, spread like the cult of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages.[...]. Written sources from the time of the Christian persecution by the Romans is the basis for the saints legends, which over the centuries were assumed by popular poetry, and frequently enriched by motifs from pagan myths.\n[Sachs 1989, 81-99]","year":1989},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Die Datierung des Bernauer Altars wird mit der Fertigstellung des Chorneubaus der Marienkirche 1519 in Zusammenhang gebracht,(Fußnote 1289) ein denkbares, wenngleich etwas spät anmutendes Datum.

He is one of the most folkloristic saints of the Middle Ages. Veneration of this saint introduced customs that are still practiced today on the day of St Nicholas. \n[... On the first panel] he throws lumps of gold through the window of a poor gentleman so that he may use it as a dowry for his three daughters and save them from the fate of prostitution. The small room shows a bed in which three girls sleep. Their shoes are placed on the step in front and their dresses hang on a rod behind. The father has opened the door silently to catch sight of the benefactor: the old, bearded man wearing a mitre and cope decorated with precious stones and holding a crosier, who appears on all four panels.\nIn the second painting he thwarts the execution of two innocents condemned to death, according to the legend it was originally three. They are already being threatened by the executioner's sword. \nWhen a famine broke out in his diocese of Myra in Asia Minor Nicholas sent a ship containing corn to the town. The ship was miraculously refilled so that it arrived at its destination without any loss. Here the valuable cargo is unloaded in the presence of Nicholas.  \nThe last panel depicts the healing of the lame at the grave of Nicholas. This is represented by a giant, undecorated sarcophagus that fills the entire pictorial space. A cripple sits in the foreground a second holds his hand under a hot oil spring rising from the grave. In the Middle Ages oil was considered to be a cure against all forms of illness.\n[Sachs 1989, 115, 116]","dimensions":"Dimensions of painted surface: 115.5 x 155.5 cm \n[Heydenreich, cda
