As a result of the large demand for Luther’s portrait during the Reformation Cranach’s representation of the reformer was frequently reproduced in his workshop in Wittenberg. This particular portrait type became the representative image of Luther for many centuries.\nLuther came to Heidelberg in 1518 as an Augustine monk to present his theological theses in the Augustine monastery. He acquired numerous supporters, among them the reformer Martin Brucer. In the Kurpfalz the Reformation was only officially introduced in 1556 by Elector Ottheinrich.\n[DH, Online database Kurpfälzisches Museum Heidelberg: https://www.museum-heidelberg.de/Museum-Heidelberg/startseite/digital/sammlung+online.html; accessed 18.06.2020]","year":2020}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1543,"dated":"about 1543","end":1543,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1532","end":"1543","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Online database Kurpfälzisches Museum Heidelberg: https://www.museum-heidelberg.de/Museum-Heidelberg/startseite/digital/sammlung+online.html; accessed 18.06.2020]","text":"after 1532"}],"remarks":"[Pendant dated]"},"description":"The panel shows Martin Luther as a half-length figure against a blue background, wearing a black gown and a beret.
