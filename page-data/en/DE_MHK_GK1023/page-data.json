[1] Schneckenburg-Broschek considers the painting in Kassel to be a copy of the version in Norfolk due to its more schematic, flat and less careful execution. This assumption appears to be contradicted by the workshop insignia on the panel in Kassel. It shows a serpent with elevated wings as was employed by the workshop until 1537. However, according to general scholarly opinion the version in Norfolk is dated after 1537, therefore the version in Kassel must also be of a later date and bear an insignia with dropped wing. In deed the erroneous use of the original insignia and the fact that the support is made of oak wood ,which was rarely used in the Cranach workshop, suggests that the painting was executed by a copyist based outside the workshop. [2] \n[1] A second copy, dated 1540 and of a painterly quality somewhere between the versions in Norfolk and Kassel, was auctioned in 2002 at Christie's (London). \n[2] Schneckenburg-Broschek does not rule out the possibility that it may have been executed in the Cranach workshop. See Heydenreich 2007, 48 for the use of oak wood in the workshop.\n\n[Exhib. Cat.

Paul and Peter are either side behind him, to the left in front of him there is a white haired zealot in armour and a surcoat, to his right the adulteress. The almost semicircular group of figures correlate through glances, gestures or poses: the old man who holds a stone behind his back and has a hat filled with stones ready has just conveyed his grievance to Christ, who looking at him has just replied. He blesses the Sinner who with downcast eyes awaits the judgement and with an affectionate gesture clasps her wrist. While Peter listens to the doctine with a thoughtful expression, Paul points forcefully in the direction of the biblical quotation above the scene. In addition in front of the crowd on the left and right behind the central group there are two men in armour. They contribute formally to the composition through their position at the edge of the painting and the fact that they face the centre. They are soldiers who wish to enforce the law. The one on the right is armed with a mace and a horseman's pick and grabs the woman by her left arm; the similarly armoured hand of an assistant rests on her right arm. The faces of the men in armour are similar to caricatures. The white haired man on the left and the armed man on the right have chunky noses which are bent upwards, a physiognomical perculiarity that is often used in painting to suggest simplicity or blindness.\n\n\n\n[Cat.
