By 1548 this type of insignia had not been employed in the Cranach workshop for at least 11 years. Since 1537 Cranach had begun signing his work with a serpent with dropped wings. On the other hand there are more than 45 known depictions of Lucretia that are partially very similar, but never identical. The present painting is – with the exception of tiny deviations – identical to a painting in the Kunstmuseum Nischni Nowgorod (Russia). The russian painting is dated 1535. Although the Cranach workshop kept templates and frequently reused them at a later stage it is unlikely that 13 years after a painting had left the workshop it would be reproduced identically.  \nA comparison with other Lucretia depictions shows that the workshop consistently adapted templates, which were frequently reused. Therefore this painting could be a copy (possibly even from 1548) after the painting in Russia, which is dated 1535. \n[Herrschaft, cda 2010]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1548,"dated":"before 1722","end":1722,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1548","end":"1548","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[The date on the painting is probably not authentic]","text":"1548"}],"remarks":"[Herrschaft, CDA 2010]"},"description":"The painting depicts Lucretia as a standing three-quarter length figure in contemporary dress. \nHer face is inclined slightly to the right and her eyes are lowered. In her raised, right hand she holds a short dagger pointed down against her chest and in her left hand she elegantly holds an overcoat. This is green and trimmed with fur and covers both shoulders. Under the overcoat Lucretia wears a precious gold and red robe with puffed white sleeves, which is open to reveal her chest. To complement the robe Lucretia wears equally precious jewellery: a neckband studded with precious stones and a necklace with three chains. Her hair is pinned up beneath a bonnet. \nThe background is dark.\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour  enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 77.3 x 53 cm\n[copy of the Auction Catalogue Van Ham, auction No. 270, 21.11.2008, in the D.
