The carefully smoothed surface on the reverse and the straight edges do not correspond with the usual finish for panels in the Cranach workshop. The profile of the frame, which is original, has not been found on any other painting from the Cranach workshop \nBetween 1530-50 the workshop produced numerous paintings that do not show any trace of underdrawing in infrared reflectograms. \nThe technique of paint application and the gilding do not correspond with the usual practice in the Cranach workshop. \nWe do not consider this painting to be a work by the Cranach workshop. Some sections exhibit similarities with works by Antonius Heusler. \nThe date on the frame ‚1549‘ and the information concerning the age of the sitter confirm his presumed identity. Count Wolfgang of Stolberg was born in 1501 and is depicted in this painting at the age of 48. \n[Heydenreich, examination report, 22.02.2016]","year":2016}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1544,"dated":"1549","end":1554,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated on the frame]"},"description":"A male portrait is shown in front of a curtain and a landscape.
