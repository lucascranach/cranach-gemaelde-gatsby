Lucretia's body is turned slightly to the left side of the painting, whereas her head is inclined to the right. With her right, raised hand she points the short dagger at herself. Lucretia wears her long hair loose and is dressed in nothing more than a transparent undergarment, that wafts to the right of the image in a light breeze. The only piece of jewellery she wears is a neckband set with precious stones. \n[Herrschaft, cda 2014]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic.\nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century.\n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 47.5 x 32.8 cm\nPainted surface:
