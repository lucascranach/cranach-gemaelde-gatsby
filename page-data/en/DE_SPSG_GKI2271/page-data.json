Commissioned by Joachim II Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop created them for the collegial church in Berlin (Berliner Stiftskirche) between 1537 and 1538. This is one of the central panels, which was probably flanked by full-length depictions of saints on the wings and complemented by scenes from the old testament on the predella. […] The Berlin Passion cycle was based on the 16 Passion altarpieces, which were commissioned by Cardinal Albrecht from Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop for the collegial church in Halle (Hallenser Stiftskirche) (about 1520-1525) and it was the second large painted Passion series created in the Cranach workshop. Not only are numerous central panels now missing from the Berlin Passion altarpieces, like for example ‚The Arrest of Christ‘ or ‚The Crucifixion‘, but in addition the whereabouts of all the wing panels and a large number of the predella panels is unknown. They were probably lost in 1613 when Elector Johann Sigismund converted to Calvinism. […]‘\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.

[…] the fact that the architecture deviates from that in traditional representations of the scene may be explained by the original position the panel occupied in the church. The missing door and the sober composition lacking in detail could also be associated with Luther’s sermon from 1533 in Torgau. In his sermon Luther specifically addressed the subject of purgatory in the visual arts and accepted depictions that served as ‘images of instruction’ to assist in the understanding of the articles of faith.  However, within this context he also warned against details, for example the door and the locks of Hell.’\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.
