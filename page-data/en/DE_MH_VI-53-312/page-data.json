Her face is turned slightly to the left and she stares into the far distance. In her left, gloved hand she holds a dagger pointed towards her breast. Her right hand touches the bottom edge of the painting. \nLucretia wears a fur-trimmed overcoat. The parallel stepped white sleeves of a dress, which reveals her chest, are visible beneath. She also wears a necklace with pearls and precious stones and a large chain around her neck. Her curls are decorated with a hair band studded with pearls. \nThe background is dark. \n[Herrschaft, CDA 2011]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 27.4 x 17.5 cm\nDimensions including frame: 37 x 27.5 cm\n[letter D.
