Lot is depicted at the centre in an affectionate embrace with one of his daughters. He is holding a large goblet, which is refilled by his other daughter who stands to his right. There is a rock behind them and beyond that on the right the flames of the burning city of Sodom are visible as well as the small white figure of Lot’s wife, turning to a pillar of salt.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 32 x 26.5 cm\n[Im Kinsky online database, accessed 23.09.2020](https://imkinsky.com/de/kaufen/ergebnisse/122/5.622//72189-lucas-cran)","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1670,"height":2000}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":240},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":479},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":719},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1670,"height":2000},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- on the rock behind Lot:\n'GENESS // XVIII // 1541'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P449","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Im Kinsky online database, accessed 23.09.2020](https://imkinsky.com/de/kaufen/ergebnisse/122/5.622//72189-lucas-cran)","role":"Artist","suffix":"Circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Im Kinsky online database, accessed 23.09.2020](https://imkinsky.com/de/kaufen/ergebnisse/122/5.622//72189-lucas-cran)","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 32 x 26.5 cm\n[Im Kinsky online database, accessed 23.09.2020](https://imkinsky.com/de/kaufen/ergebnisse/122/5.622//72189-lucas-cran)"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1541","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P449","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P449_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Lot and his Daughters"},"objectId":985991,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- private collection, Austria\n- auction, Im Kinsky, Vienna, 24.04.2018, lot 0715\n[Im Kinsky online database, accessed 23.09.2020](https://imkinsky.com/de/kaufen/ergebnisse/122/5.622//72189-lucas-cran)","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"30.01.2018","endDate":"30.01.2018"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"23.
