He is paired with his predecessor and brother, the Elector Frederick III of Saxony (1463-1525), who was Cranach's most important early patron. Cranach entered his service at the court in Wittenberg in the spring of 1505. Thereafter Cranach remained with the house of Saxony for nearly fifty years, serving three successive Electors, the second being John the Steadfast.
