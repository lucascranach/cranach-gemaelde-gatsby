She holds the infant Christ on her lap, who takes a berry offered to him by a cherub. A further three cherubs are busy collecting berries in the foreground, a forth stands at the Virgin's left, and together with another two cherubs he holds a dark curtain that serves as a backdrop for the figurative group.
