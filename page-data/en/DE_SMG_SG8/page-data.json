In contrast to the portraits from the 1532 series, which are slightly more three dimensional, those of the two panels in Gotha are more flat and plain, even after consideration of the in part heavy abrasion and cracking. The execution of the panels in Gotha shows that the lines of the underdrawing were precisely followed during the painting process in correspondance  with the requirements for an economic production with the aim to create an exact replica. The attached paper strips are also of interest for another reason: these may not only have served an economic purpose - saving time by printing - , but also make another mediality tangible and combine the traits of a painting with the potential media power of the printed word. \n[Sebastian Dohe, in Exhib.
