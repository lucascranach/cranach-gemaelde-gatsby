A former theory suggesting that the sitter is Ursula Rehdinger cannot be confirmed. The letters O.M.V.I.A on Ursula’s neckband, referring to „Omnia vincit amor“ (Love vanquishes all) in Virgil’s 10 Eclogue, support the thesis, that it could be a crypto-portrait of a concubine (Leys Schütz?). Erotic connotations are also suggested by the direct eye contact between the two figures and the alignment of the arrow, which like Cupid’s arrow is pointing at Erasmus/Albrecht. […]\nThe present presentation of both panels as a diptych is probably not authentic. Originally they would have been wing panels of an altarpiece of which the central panel is now lost.’ \n[Elke A.
