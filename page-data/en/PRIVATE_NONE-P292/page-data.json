an independent restorer who is not an employee of Sotheby's. \n\"The oak panel has one central vertical split along which there is slight movement. There are also some minor vertical splits from the bottom. The paint layer is stable but there is raised paint along the vertical shrinkage cracks particularly in the flesh tones. The background has been augmented where there has been earlier thinness, now discoloured, and some of the shadows of the flesh tones have been augmented. Tonally, the painting would improve with the removal of the varnish. Overall, in good condition.\"\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-sale-l08031/lot.13.html?locale=en] (accessed 13.08.2019)","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2008","endDate":"2008"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"15.
