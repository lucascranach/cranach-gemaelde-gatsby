The lion is similar to the representation on the panel showing St Jerome in his Study, 1525, in Darmstadt [DE_HLMD_GK71]. \nThe painter evidently borrowed numerous elements from Cranach’s works from about 1525/26. However the character of the support (size and proportions) and the painting technique of this painting differ considerably from contemporary common practice in the Cranach workshop and it is therefore not a workshop production. \nA similar style and painting technique to this panel is found in many works attributed to Antonius Heusler.\nA comparison with verified and signed works by Heusler reveals similarities in e. g. the modulation of the flesh paint, the representation of the eyes, the execution of the hair as well as the depiction of foliage. The underdrawings found on verified works by Heusler vary significantly in character, making it impossible to make any firm attribution here. Heusler’s signed works exhibit underdrawings with brushstrokes of varying widths and grey values as well as alternating loose and controlled lines. From 1534 Heusler signed and dated most of his works. However, on this painting neither signature nor date could be found.\n[unpublished examination report, G.
