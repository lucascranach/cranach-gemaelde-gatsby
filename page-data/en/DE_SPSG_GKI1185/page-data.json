They were distributed in books for the education of princes (>>Fürstenspiegel<<) as well as being used to decorate representative rooms in castles and town halls. Associated with the depiction of these narratives was the idea that the virtues and vices of illustrious figures could provide standards and role models for political action. The exempla of virtue could on the one hand have a moralizing-didactic character by illustrating correct behavior to the princes or councillors; they could also serve the legitimization of political power and interests by justifying the ruler’s virtuous behavior. The panels in Berlin illustrate the monarchical virtues of moderation, wisdom, justice and courage. […]\n\nIt may be assumed, that the complex content and composition of the four paintings were based on a design by the father. These were then executed rapidly – probably under the supervision of Lucas Cranach the Younger - by workshop members. This would explain slight inconsistencies in the proportions and other formal details. Friedländer, Rosenberg and Schade on the other hand suggest that the painting is an autographed work by the son.‘\n\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat. Berlin 2009, 200-201, no.

He must choose the most beautiful of the three goddesses Hera, Athena or Aphrodite. Each goddess promises him something: Hera offers him power, Athena offers him wisdom and Aphrodite promises him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris chooses Aphrodite. Helena the most beautiful mortal is married to the Spartan King Menelaos. Her abduction leads to the Trojan war and the downfall of Troy. \nCompared with other depictions of the subject, not only by Cranach, but also by other artists the painting in Berlin is characterized by the fact that the goddesses are indistinguishable. All three wear nothing more than a thin veil, which doesn't conceal their body and numerous necklaces. Two of them look towards Paris, whereas the third one, who touches his armor, looks out at the viewer. Behind the goddesses the messenger Hermes has raised his staff with which he beats Paris on the chest, warning him of female seduction with a loud cry and admonishing him to make a prudent decision.\nThe scene takes place against a backdrop of thick undergrowth where Paris's white horse stands and beyond which a landscape unfolds. A cherub hovers in the sky above with his bow drawn. \n[see Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat. Berlin 2009, 202, no.
