Lucretia holds a long dagger in her right hand and with the tip pointing upwards she has turned it on herself, while in her left hand she holds a transparent veil. This is knotted on her left shoulder and wound around her hips, but its transparency does not conceal her vulva.  \nLucretia wears a richly embellished neckband as jewellery and her blond hair is pinned up beneath a net bonnet.\nAn interior is indicated in the background. On the right a dark curtain is visible, and on the left there is a window through which a mountain landscape with a castle and a small town can be seen. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: \n39 x 26 cm\n[Yeide 2009, 233, No. A10]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1794,"height":2590}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":289},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":577},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":866},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1794,"height":2590},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1951,"height":2727}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":283},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001r-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":566},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001r-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":850},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001r-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1942,"height":2750},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001r-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001r.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":280},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001v-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":559},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001v-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":839},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001v-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1951,"height":2727},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001v-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K/11_RKD/PRIVATE_NONE-P067_FR240K_RKD_Overall-001v.dzi"}}]},"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P067","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Annotation on the reverse of a photograph in the Archive D.
