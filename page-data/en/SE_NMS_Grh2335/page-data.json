Although all gospels record the miracle Cranach chose, not by chance, John 6, 1-15 the only biblical reference where the boy is mentioned as bringing the food. This interpretation corresponds with the presence among the crowd of many children, some playing with their mothers or being breast fed. \n[Görres, Exhib. Cat.

Christ was anxious to provide food for the crowd, but the disciples could only bring him a boy who had five fish and three loaves to sell. Thereupon Christ said the prayer of thanksgiving and the loaves and fishes were enough to satisfy everyone. This multiplication of the loaves and fishes is traditionally interpreted as a prefiguration of the Eucharist. Cranach arranged the heads of the onlookers along the diagonal axis of the painting. As such he followed a concept that he had already employed in 'The Sermon of St John the Baptist' from 1516, a vertical format woodcut that is related in content. The apostles have taken the boy in their midst and he looks up in amazement at Christ blessing. [Görres, Exhib. Cat.
