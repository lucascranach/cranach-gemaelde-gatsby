Furthermore the inventory from that date states that the panel originally came from Altenburg. Like Saxony-Gotha the duchy of Saxony-Altenburg was also created by the division of land among the descendants of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous. The panel in Gotha was therefore most probably once the property of the ernestine electors. \nIn addition to the panel in Gotha only one other panel from the 16th century is recorded as having been created within a lutheran context: the St Annaberg panel, an epitaph for Elizabeth Kantz who died in 1571. \nSchade and Schuttwolf are justified in their doubts on the authourship of the small format panel. However despite this the original insignia and the stylistic characteristics leave no doubt that it was created in the workshop. Furthermore the dimensions of the panel support this attribution. The dimension of the panel correspond with formats repeatedly employed by the Cranach workshop, like among others: portraits of Luther and Katharina von Bora, Philipp Melanchton, Friedrich the Wise and Johannes the Steadfast.\n[Benjamin D.

Jesus is positioned in the centre of a composition set against a black background, and wears a blue undergarment and a luminous red cloak. He holds the sinner's wrist in his left hand and points towards her with his right hand. The woman is shown with a slightly inclined head, looking out at the viewer. She wears a red dress with the lacing open to reveal her breasts. Her right arm is held by a man in armour. A second soldier at the left edge holds a number of stones at the ready for the execution. Further scribes and Pharisees stand either side of the adulteress and Jesus. \n[Benjamin D. Spira, in Exhib. Cat.
