XI, no. 7, November 23, 1912, is an illustration of a painting that looks remarkably like the present work, except that the sitter wears an embroidered waistcoat rather than a plain one and there is no date visible in the background. The caption underneath reads 'Portrait of a Man, By Lucas Cranach. Sold by the Henry Reinhardt Galleries to a Western Collector.\" It is possible that the date was painted over in the Reinhardt painting in order to sell it as a work of Cranach the Elder, but that does not explain the change in the costume. We cannot even be certain that this is the same picture, but we have had the signature and date on the present painting tested and they are contemporary with the rest of the work.  \n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.102.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","year":2012},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"The portrait is in many ways comparable to a Portrait of a Man in the De Young Museum, San Francisco.

It is in the field of portraiture that Cranach the Younger most sets himself apart from the works of his father and the older generation of artists. Beginning in the 1540s he forges a style in which clearly articulated features are more fully integrated into the composition as whole. However, he retains an extraordinary refinement of touch, most notable here in the delicate patterning of the lace beneath the sitter's small ruff. \n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.102.html?locale=en;
