The focus seems to be more on his triumph over death than his suffering, and there is the suggestion of resurrection imagery in the hill like ground that he stands on, the low horizon and the accompanying putti in the clouds. Cranach treats Christ as Man of Sorrows in an almost miniaturist style, using fine brushwork to define the figure and his wounds.  It is an apparently unique composition for no other versions are known. Both the brushwork and the form of the signature point to its being a work of the 1540s. \n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-paintings-n08952/lot.64.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 20.2 x 13.5 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-paintings-n08952/lot.64.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1803,"height":2634}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":292},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":584},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":877},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1803,"height":2634},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P255","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-paintings-n08952/lot.64.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-paintings-n08952/lot.64.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 20.2 x 13.5 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-paintings-n08952/lot.64.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1540 - 1549","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P255","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P255_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Christ as the Man of Sorrows"},"objectId":951786,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- Adanero Collection, Spain, during the 19th century, and in the collection of descendants of the Count of Adanero until the late 20th century [1]\n- until acquired by the present owner\n- 01.02.2013 sold by Sotheby's, New York\n[1]The Conde de Adanero assembled one of the most important collections in Spain during the 18th century.
