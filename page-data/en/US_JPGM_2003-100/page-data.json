The decorative neatness is comparable with the large painting of 'Venus and Cupid as the Honey Thief', (FR204k, now in London, National Gallery) from about 1526, which is perhaps the earliest painted version of the new Venus-Cupid subject (see No. 570, Fig. 321), comparable also with the colourful, stringent composition of the larger 'Fall of Man' dated 1526, FR 161 [Ruhmer 1963, Plate 22]. The undated painting of the same size of 'Apollo and Diana' in London (FR [222], 84 x 56.5 cm mentioned under No. 503) could be the pendant of our 'Family of Wild People'  (similar rod-like trees, sky colouring and decorative character). The man sitting on the stone block placed at an angle is prefigured in woodcuts from 1523 and 1524: the humanist figure of Sophrosyne (No. 251, Fig. 204) and the armed warrior Joshua (No. 227, fig. 304; Ho. H. 5a) – both iconographically not far apart from the notion of the wild people, their battle and their humanist allegory.\nThe seated man has slightly pointed ears, which befits a faun or a 'silvanus' (fauns otherwise usually appear with horns or hooves, similar to satyrs, that have a tail). A similar figure, also armed with a club, 'protects' in the form of a fountain figure the reclining nymph in Cranach's painting from 1518 (FR 100); banned to the fountain sculpture the faun-like figure with pointed ears is prevented from bothering the nymph, as is otherwise the case (Fig. 238). See the introduction to 10. Subject Matter Group with the 'Wild People' above for the evolution of the subject from late Medieval graphic art like No. 494 and from Cranach's 'bound' representations of the faun or the wild people in book illustrations 1521/23 (p. 324 descriptive title page no. 218, fig. 302, and title page No. 233f., Figs. 187f.) and the large woodcut portrait of Christian of Denmark from 1523 (No. 160, fig. 114; see also the title page used in Cranach circles in Wittenberg from 1529: J. Luther, Plate 48), and p. 211 and 430. The defeated lion already appears in the portrait woodcut from 1523: embedded within the columns (early forms of this defeated lion are found in accordance with ancient tradition on the plinths of numerous reliquaries, which were represented in woodcuts by Cranach in the Wittenberg Prayer book (Heiligtumsbuch) in 1509, No. 95-100: Ho. 96/Schu. 13, 40, 45, 46, 64, 104, 107, 110). The contemplative mood after the act and before the future destiny of these 'primatives' recalls a painting attributed to Fra Bartolommeo (Florence 1472-1517) showing Adam and Eve after the expulsion from paradise: Adam seated naked on a stone, his hand supported on his heel, Eve striding before him with her two small children, one in her arms the other holding her hand (Museum of Philadelphia, John G. Johnson Collection; The Burlington Magazine, XLIV, 1924, Fig. beside p. 113). The contemplative mood incited by the Cranach painting is enhanced by the evening (or morning) sky tones (as is described in  No. 290 and which also appear in No. 501, and Nos. 93, 286, 288, 333, 387, 388, 471, 476, 478, 523, 547, 574, 574a, 582, 618; always indicating something uncanny, early and iconographically particularly insightful in the painting of a 'Reclining Nymph' keenly guarded by a faun, dated 1518, FR 100; Cranach-Fs. 1953, Fig. 100; Schade 1974, Plate 97; with regards the yellowish colouring above the horizon of Cranach's paintings see comments under No. 594).'\n \n[Koepplin, Falk, Exhib.

Although the precise subject of this painting remains obscure, it recalls the legendary \"wild man\" found in medieval mythology, as well as idyllic forest dwellers, such as fauns, described in Greek poetry. \n\nThe male faun sits on a rock, staff in hand, with a slain lion at his feet. He gazes toward a woman--presumably his wife--and their children. Dark foliage mediates between them and a stunning landscape: a lake, a village, mountains, and a castle in the distance. Isolated and protected from civilization, these figures represent the wild traits of mankind. On the other hand, the faun's humanlike appearance, the woman's calm demeanor, and the baby's tender gesture suggest more civilized aspects of society. \n\nAside from this broader narrative, Cranach's finely worked style draws attention to incidental elements, such as the lion's fur and a man and a horse and cart climbing the castle-topped mountain. The lion's stylized body fits perfectly in the painting's lower left corner. Such attention to detail and Cranach's complex subject matter appealed to the refined tastes of his learned, courtly patrons.\n\n[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=244856; 21.07.2010]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 82.9 x 56.2 cm\nDimensions including the frame: 100 x 73.3 x 3.8 x 8.6 cm\n\n[The J.

It appeared to have been cleaned and restored in the relatively recent past. The varnish was flat, however, and did not saturate the paint properly, especially noticeable in the darks. Older retouches had discolored and appeared to be more generous than needed. Ultraviolet illumination revealed an uneven cleaning, with older varnish residues remaining in many areas.\nThe top layer of recent varnish and some of the old retouchings were removed with a 30/70 mixture of acetone and Shell Sol 71. Other old retouchings were removed with acetone and a knife (under the microscope). The remnants of the very old retouchings still remaining on the nude female figure were removed manually, under the microscope, with a knife. It became clear that the outline of this old retouching - the drapery which had been present in the 1962 photograph - was still visible due to the fact that the top layer of copper resinate in the foliage had been removed, no doubt when the drapery was removed. The older retouchings covering the larger loss in the lion and the hole in the Faun's torso were left in place, as they had not discolored. Further retouching, however, was needed to match them more completely to the surrounding original paint.\n\nRestoration\nA thin coat of Regalrez resin in Shell Sol 340 HT (7% solution with tinuvin, a hindered amine light stabilizer) was brushed on.\nAreas of loss were filled with a calcium sulfate/animal skin glue gesso. Retouches of paint losses in the painting were executed with Schminke Gouache colors for the base layer and Gamblin Retouch colors for the successive glazes needed to\nmatch the colors exactly. Successive thin layers of Regalrez varnish were sprayed on and quickly brushed out.\n\n[US_JPGM_2003-100_FR267_2004_TreatmentReport.pdf]","signature":{"date":"02.
