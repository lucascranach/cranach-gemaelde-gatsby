Furthermore the identical coats of arms show that both parents were members of the Miltitz family. The origin of the epitaph from the castle of Siebeneichen near (today in) Meißen, which was built in 1550, suggests that it was transferred from one of the neighbouring churches. The rank and reputation of the Milititz family suggest that the epitaph was not executed by one of Cranach's workshop assistants. Therefore the panel is with good reason attributed to Lucas Cranach the Younger. \n[Löcher, in Cat.

However, the image created for the deceased child, Jorge (Georg) von Miltitz (1544-1548), departs from the known category that included the donors. The child, dressed in a white shroud, is raised up out of a sarcophagus located on the summit of a green hill by angels that are also childlike in appearance. Above this the enthroned figure of Christ as judge appears on a circular rainbow with the globe at his feet. [...] The bottom, red field contains the Miltitz family coat of arms twice: the shield is divided into eight silver and black fields, the mantling on the helm is black and silver and it is decorated with a crown and black and silver buffalo horns. \n[Löcher, in Cat.
