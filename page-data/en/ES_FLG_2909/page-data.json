It is as such a pictorial type, which endeavours to illustrate the events around Christ's death as recorded in the bible particularly with regards to the participants. Numerous soldiers and men on horseback are shown beneath the three crosses of Christ and the two thieves. Many of the men on horseback have a portrait-like appearance, without in fact being portraits of living people. The converted centurion is on horseback at the left with his hand raised. In the foreground on the left together with St John the women take care of the Virgin, who has collapsed; on the right in the foreground soldiers rally around and cast dice for Christ's robe. \n[cda 2021]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 65.5 x 41.5 cm\nDimensions including frame: 77.2 x 53.2 x 5.5 cm\n[Museo Lázaro Galdiano online database, accessed 05.03.2021](http://catalogo.museolazarogaldiano.es/mlgm/search/pages/ResultSearch?Museo=MLGM&txtSimpleSearch=Cranach,%20Lucas%20(El%20Joven)&simpleSearch=0&hipertextSearch=1&search=simple&MuseumsSearch=MLGM)","exhibitionHistory":"","images":null,"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"ES_FLG_2909","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Museo Lázaro Galdiano online database, accessed 05.03.2021](http://catalogo.museolazarogaldiano.es/mlgm/search/pages/ResultSearch?Museo=MLGM&txtSimpleSearch=Cranach,%20Lucas%20(El%20Joven)&simpleSearch=0&hipertextSearch=1&search=simple&MuseumsSearch=MLGM) [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 377D]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32402","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"España > regions > Madrid > provinces > Madrid > inhabited places > Madrid","term":"Madrid","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"España > regions > Madrid > provinces > Madrid > inhabited places > Madrid","term":"Madrid","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Museo Lázaro Galdiano online database, accessed 05.03.2021](http://catalogo.museolazarogaldiano.es/mlgm/search/pages/ResultSearch?Museo=MLGM&txtSimpleSearch=Cranach,%20Lucas%20(El%20Joven)&simpleSearch=0&hipertextSearch=1&search=simple&MuseumsSearch=MLGM)","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 65.5 x 41.5 cm\nDimensions including frame: 77.2 x 53.2 x 5.5 cm\n[Museo Lázaro Galdiano online database, accessed 05.03.2021](http://catalogo.museolazarogaldiano.es/mlgm/search/pages/ResultSearch?Museo=MLGM&txtSimpleSearch=Cranach,%20Lucas%20(El%20Joven)&simpleSearch=0&hipertextSearch=1&search=simple&MuseumsSearch=MLGM)"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1550","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"ES_FLG_2909","imgSrc":"","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Crucifixion"},"objectId":1001961,"objectName":"FR377D","owner":"Museo Lázaro Galdiano, Madrid","provenance":"- part of the Lázaro collection since 1926\n[Museo Lázaro Galdiano online database, accessed 05.03.2021](http://catalogo.museolazarogaldiano.es/mlgm/search/pages/ResultSearch?Museo=MLGM&txtSimpleSearch=Cranach,%20Lucas%20(El%20Joven)&simpleSearch=0&hipertextSearch=1&search=simple&MuseumsSearch=MLGM)","publications":[{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"29776","title":"Arbeteta Mira 2005"},{"pageNumber":"59","referenceId":"29475","title":"Camon Aznar 1951"},{"pageNumber":"85","referenceId":"152","title":"Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"417","title":"Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979"},{"pageNumber":"475, vol.
