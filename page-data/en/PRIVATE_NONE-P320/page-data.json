She is wearing a sumptuous dress decorated with gold brocade across the bib and along the hems. The sleeves are made less monotonous with decorative slits where the white undergarment puffs out beneath the shoulder and at the elbows. In addition her hair has been pinned up above her head and she has both a double linked chain and a neckband set with precious stones, with dangling pearls and a pendant. A mountainous background is visible through the window.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 66 x 59 cm\n[Exhib. Cat.
