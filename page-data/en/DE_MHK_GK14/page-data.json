Nevertheless the subject of  the honest virtue of the heroine and above all her exposure legitimises the beautiful sight for the (male) viewer. [1]  An invoice from the Wittenberg court from the year 1518 mentions two depictions of Lucretia, which Cranach had placed in cases - perhap as a form of protection for transportation, but more likely to secure private if not intime contemplation.[2]\nThe early and initially mostly half-length representations of Lucretia by Cranach from about 1510 can be traced back to a netherlandish pictorial type employed by Joos van Cleve and others, which the artist must have seen during his trip to Antwerp in 1508.[3] Although the panel in Kassel is very similar to this prototype later Cranach's evolution of this subjet took another path, renouncing the motif of  gradual disclosure. His workshop produced around about 40 different versions of the subject with varying basic types. \n[1] See: Tacke 2010, 10 f.\n[2] Schade 1974, 409, No. 151\n[3] See Exhib. Cat.

Her head is inclined slightly to the left and she stares into the far distance. Her hands hold the dagger in her lap, and it is pointed towards her breast. \nLucretia wears a dark, contemporary dress. The sleeves are stepped and have decorative slits. She wears a white undergarment that billows out above the elbow, and has slipped off her shoulder to reveal her breast. She is framed by a red fur-lined overcoat, which is draped over her left shoulder, falls down her back and emerges on the right to cover her lap. Her blond hair is pinned up artistically and decorated with pearls. Around her neck she wears a heavy chain, a delicate gold necklace and a chain with pearls and precious stones with a renaissance pendant. The precious jewellery is contrasted by the simplicity of the long dagger. \nThere is a mountainous landscape with a castle in the background. \n[see Cat. Kassel 1997, 65-68]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 41.6 x 28.3 cm\n[Cat.
