Durer painted the Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand Christians for the Saxon Elector Friedrich III between 1507 and 1508.128 Cranach finished the Budapest Martyrdom of St Catherine (fig. 40)129 of approximately the same size and proportion at about the same time. It probably relates to a further meeting of both artists. As the features of the wooden support for the Martyrdom of St Catherine differ noticeably\nfrom those of other Wittenberg works (see p. 65), it seems likely that the panel was produced outside the workshop, perhaps even in Nuremberg.130 This assertion is supported by the observation that Cranach probably used motifs of the Heller Altarpiece, which were being produced at the same time\nin Durer ’s workshop (1507/09).131 In addition, Cranach gave this work special attention in terms of composition and technical execution. The preliminary design on the panel appears to have been drawn in a concentrated way and with shadows partially deepened by hatching (fig. 87). This is reminiscent of Durer ’s urge for precision.132 Subsequently, Cranach applied the reddish imprimatura .133 In the course of the painting process, the composition was corrected again; the colour, plasticity as well as the materiality were modeled with an extra ordinary sensibility. Some passages of paint were accentuated in a graphic way with a pointed brush, which again reveals a direct relation to Dürer’ s meticulous painting (figs 273, 278).”\n \n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 318]","year":2007},{"author":"Guido Messling","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"'The panel in Budapest was first identified by Fenyö 1955 as an early major work by Cranach and ranks with its confident underdrawing and both assured and careful jewel-like rendering among the highest quality panels by Cranach, in which workshop participation is unlikely. The date of the painting however remains controversial. Fenyö and most recently Brinkmann suggest 1504/05, during the initial period of Cranach's activity at the Wittenberg court, whereas Koepplin and Grimm advocate a date about 1508/09, directly before or after his journey to the Netherlands. The relationship of the panel to the 'Martyrdom of St Catharine' from 1506 in Dresden (FR 014, Fig. 78), which depicts the subject less dramatically and more flat, is frequently addressed within this context.  Not only the soft manner of blending paint in the vegetation and the accomplished spatial setting of the central group of the henchmen and the saints, for which the jumble of falling men serves as a backdrop suggest a creation date after this painting; but also the affinity of the two central figures to the woodcut from about 1508/09 depicting 'The Beheading of St John the Baptist' (No. 67) points in this direction.\nFurthermore it is remarkable that the underdrawing of the henchman is even closer to the figure of his colleague in the woodcut.  In addition to the printed graphic prototypes by Dürer and the Monogrammist MZ (Nos. 18 and 19) shown here, Cranach may, as suggested by Grimm, also have known the depiction of the martyr on the inner side of the right wing of Dürer’s Heller-Altar, created in Nuremberg between 1507 and 1509. Cranach was in the free imperial city (freie Recihsstadt) in January and July of 1508 from where he set off to the Netherlands. Of interest in this respect is Heydenreich’s observation that the construction of the panel differs from those created in Wittenberg during these years, so the painting could have been created on a journey. Unfortunately the origin of this important painting is unknown before 1791, when it was acquired in Leipzig as a work by Dürer.’ \n \n[Messling , Exhib. Cat.

There is little doubt that this painting support came from a different professional panel maker . The cost for transporting supports was relatively high compared to those of production.116 Was this support made at a place where Cranach stopped during his travels, perhaps even in\nNuremberg?117 The methods used are found on various Nuremberg supports of the same period.118'\n \n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 65]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"'On the panel depicting the Martyrdom of St Catherine (c.1508, ffig. 40), the black line on the upper and lower border ends with the barb, leaving some bare wood visible on the edge of the panel.

The Artist in His Studio53 shows a large panel standing on an easel. Grooved battens were temporarily attached to the upper and lower edge in order to stabilise the panel. It could thus be moved safely within the workshop. This assumes that there were similar pieces of squared wood as interim devices to exert a stabilising force used in the Cranach workshop during the early Wittenberg years. It is conceivable that they formed part of the temporary frame used during grounding when the aqueous medium might cause the panel to distort.54 It remains to be investigated whether they also served to hold the boards during joining.'\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 86]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"'In X-radiographs of the Budapest Martyrdom of St Catherine (c.1508), changes in the choice of material, for example, gold leaf instead of a robe painted yellow, are revealed.
