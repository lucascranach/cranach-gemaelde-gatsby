She is shown as a full-length figure, standing on a narrow strip of stony ground, facing to her right against a dark backdrop, and unusually she is accompanied by two ladies. She rests the sword on her left shoulder and holds up the general's decapitated head in her right hand. Judith is wearing a sumptuous dress with puffed sleeves and brocade bands and a snood covers her hair. This outfit is complemented by a chain with a pendant and numerous rings decorating her fingers. Her companions also wear courtly attire. The lady on her left holds up a sack for the offending head.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 53 x 37.8 cm \n[handwritten annotation on the reverse of a b/w photograph; Koepplin
