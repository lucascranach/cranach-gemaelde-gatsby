He holds a lily and a sword. He turns to the Virgin, who kneels to his left while St John the Baptist assumes the same pose on the right. Behind them the female saints gather on the left and the male saints on the right and are surrounded by clouds. Above there are winged angels' heads on both sides. In the lower section of the panel the consequences of the judgement are shown. Devils and demons plunge the naked condemned into Hell from which flames and steam rise. The left side shows the righteous entering paradise, accompanied by an angel and St Peter. Peter wears a splendidly decorated chasuble with the true image of Christ. \nVerso: The painting on the reverse of the predella, which is of a later date and by another hand shows the same image of Christ on the Veil of Veronica. \n\n[Görres, cda 2013]","dimensions":"Dimensions of visible surface: 120 x 211.5 cm\n[Heydenreich, cda
