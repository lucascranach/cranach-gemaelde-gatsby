Although the general placement of Adam and Eve in these paintings reflects the influence of Albrecht Dürer's renowned classicizing treatment of the same subject in paintings and prints, Cranach's slender, undulating figures conform to the contemporary courtly ideals of beauty. This pair is one of the finest of the many versions of the subject made by Cranach and his workshop.\n[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111718?search_no=8&index=2] (accessed 24.09.2012)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 107.5 x 36.4 cm (42 5/16 x 14 5/16 in.)\nDimensions of the painted surface: 105.7 x 36.4 cm (41 5/8 x 14 5/16 in.)\n[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111718?search_no=8&index=2] (accessed 24.09.2012)","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":852,"height":2438}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":608},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1216},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1824},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":987,"height":3000},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":572},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1145},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1717},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":852,"height":2438},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":572},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1145},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1717},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":852,"height":2438},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-294_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-294_FR197_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_artic_1935-294","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111718?search_no=8&index=2] (accessed 24.09.2012)","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > states > Illinois > counties > Cook > inhabited places > Chicago","term":"Chicago","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > states > Illinois > counties > Cook > inhabited places > Chicago","term":"Chicago","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on beech wood\n[Cat.
