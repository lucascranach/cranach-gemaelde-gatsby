XRF analysis (Niton XLt) detected the following elements: lead (lead white) and calcium (probably chalk).

However, the detailed underdrawing is different in character to those found on other works firmly attributed to Cranach or his workshop."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"Using XRF analysis (Niton XLt) various elements were detected in the paint and by comparing their optical characteristics the following pigments were identified: \n\nRed: Pb: lead white; Zn: zink white (?); Hg: vermillion; Fe: iron oxide/ ochre; Cu: blue or green pigment containing copper; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\nWhite: Pb: lead white; Hg: vermillion; Fe: iron oxide/ ochre; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\nGreen: Pb: lead white; Sn, Pb: lead tin yellow I; Fe: iron oxide/ ochre; Cu: blue or green pigment containing copper; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\nYellow: Pb: lead white; Zn: zink white (?); Sn, Pb: lead-tin-yellow I; Hg: vermillion; Fe, Mn: iron oxide/ ochre; Cu: blue or green pigment containing copper; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\nFlesh paint: Pb: lead white; Zn: zink white (?); Hg: vermillion; Cu: blue or green pigment containing copper; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\nLight green: Pb: lead white; Sn, Pb: lead-tin yellow I; Cu: blue or green pigment containing copper; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\nBrown: Pb: lead white; Zn: zink white (?); Hg: vermillion; Fe: iron oxide/ ochre; Cu: blue or green pigment containing copper; Ca: chalk/ gypsum\n\n\nThe following pigments were employed: lead white, vermillion, ochre, copper green and lead-tin-yellow. Not all pigments and dyes could be identified. Traces of zink in isolated areas of the painting suggest the use of a paint containing zink for retouching. \n\n\nThe paint was applied in thin layers with both flat and pointed brush. Only minor deviations from the underdrawing can be seen in the painted version e. g. the head of the rider in the background was not executed in the painted version. \n\nThe initial flat application of dead colouring was only modulated in paint to a small extent to create areas of light and shadow. The contours of details were for the most part emphasized with black lines executed with a fine-tipped paint brush. For example the robe of the man on the right hand side of the painting, where the ochre base colour is differentiated using a few light yellow folds (lead tin yellow). Shadows were subsequently defined with black hatching strokes. The flesh paint was applied over a greyish underpaint in a few different flesh tones and defined using black lines. In contrast the modulation of the foliage was applied over a black underpaint, using green paint and green glazes.\n\nThe identified pigments were frequently employed in Cranach’s workshop and other medieval and renaissance workshops throughout Europe. The identification of lead tin yellow I suggests the painting was created either before 1750 or after 1940. Lead tin yellow went out of fashion after 1750 and was not rediscovered until the early 1940s. However the conspicuous use of calligraphic lines for the contours and details are not typical of Cranach’s practice and it may be assumed that this painting was not produced in the workshop.\n\n[unpublished examination report, Blumenroth, Dietz, Heydenreich 18.03.2018]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"None","sortingNumber":"1603-008-01","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"42.50","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"The Mocking of Job","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":286},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none_2017_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":572},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none_2017_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":857},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none_2017_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4630,"height":6616},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none_2017_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P334_FR-none_2017_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
