Streaky, grey washes were in part employed for the initial layer of the trees and the ground, the areas of shadow in the flesh paint  were also executed with a thin greyish-brown wash. flesh tones were applied over this employing a semi-transparent paint. Finally highlights, contours and fine lines were added. The hair, the trees and the ground were laid in with monochrom semi-opaque brown admixtures. Afer drying the shadows were indicated with brown tones and in part blended, fine lines and fleeting grey highlights were added last. \n- brush application, glazes, almost graphic isolated and linear highlights \n- small to smallest size brush \n- examination under the stereomicroscope showed that the engaged frame was finished after the panel had been painted.
