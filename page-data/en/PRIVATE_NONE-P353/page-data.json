Christ and the two thieves are positioned against an empty sky, raised high above the throng of onlookers and soldiers on horseback. It is only the lances that penetrate this space. The good thief, crucified at Jesus's right hand, gazes up at him with acceptance, while the bad thief looks away. This conventional division of positive and negative on either side of the cross continues below with the mourning friends of Christ occupy the lower left corner of the composition. The swooning Virgin is supported by Saint John the Evangelist and two women. Opposite these holy figures are the soldiers who cast dice to determine who will take possession of Christ's clothing.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 38 x 24 cm\n[Auct. Cat.
