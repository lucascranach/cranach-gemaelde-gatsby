The earliest examples are woodcuts printed in Bamberg (in about 1500 and 1503), woodcuts created in 1515 by Hans von Kulmbach and Erhart Sch√∂n were formative for this tradition. The painted, almost never carved, panels always followed the same design with the same hierarchy for both altarpieces and epitaphs; and generally relied on printed prototypes. However, in all cases they exhibit slight individual variations, like the number and choice of saints, or the elaboration of single motifs. The iconographic tradition suggests that similar to other examples of this type the cropped top of the Bamberg panel would have originally exhibited spandrels depicting two scenes, probably the Mass of St Gregory and the Stigmatization of St Francis. These are represented in the woodcuts from 1515 that also show rare representations of the estates of the realm.\nChristoph Bellot in: [Exner 2015, 957]","year":2015}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1514,"dated":"about 1515 - 1520","end":1523,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[https://virtueller-domrundgang.eo-bamberg.de/; accessed 26-03-2019]"},"description":"The panel shows a wreath of roses, occupying the entire pictorial space. It consists of five times ten white roses divided into the five decades of the rosary by five larger red roses. Christ on the cross is positioned at the centre of the gilded inner area of the wreath and cloud bands indicate the hierarchy in heaven: God the Father and the Holy Ghost are represented at the top above the cross, beneath them at the left the intercessory Virgin, at the right an angel; at the left under the horizontal member of the cross are representatives of the Old Testament (David, Moses and St John the Baptist) and at the right the apostles and the evangelists, beneath them at the left male saints (Sts Christopher, Erasmus, Lawrence and the Holy Innocents) and at the right the Latin Fathers, Sts Henry II, Sebald, Francis etc., beneath these are female saints either side of the cross (at the left among others Sts Catherine, Barbara and Apollonia, at the right Kunigunde and others). A choir of nine angels encircles the saints within the wreath. In the lower section of the painting 'the earth' is represented by an expansive landscape; members of the clerical estate (Pope [Leo X ?], a cardinal, a bishop, priests and other clergy) kneel at the left under the wreath of roses, while representatives of the worldly estate (with Emperor [Maximilian?], a prince and the bourgeoisie) are shown at the right. \nChristoph Bellot in: [Exner 2015,

It has been in the cathedral since at least the beginning of the 18th century, contrary to the unsubstantiated, generally quoted assumption that it was originally from the Dominican church in Bamberg and was transferred to the cathedral after the secularisation of the church. In 1649/50 the panel was probably integrated in the new design of the St Maurice altar in front the St Peter's choir. It is evidently the painting on the altar referred to as a good piece of painting ('gute[n] Stuck von Marlerey') in the list of altarpieces from the second half of the 18th century.
