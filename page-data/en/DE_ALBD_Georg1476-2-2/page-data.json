Melanchthon is wearing the typical black gown. The image is framed by a blue boarder containing the nine coats-of-arms of Anhalt as well as Melanchthon's own coat-of-arms, which is located beneath the image. \n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of painted surface: 27.6 x 18.7 cm\n[Nadine Willing-Stritzke, in Exhib.
