Although the reformers face each other they gaze into the far distance. Luther is shown as higher ranking: he is on the heraldic right side occupying more of the pictorial plane and as such towers over Melanchthon. Both are placed in front of a neutral background and each appears to offer the viewer an open book over a stone balustrade. \n[Susanne Wegmann, in Exhib. Cat.
