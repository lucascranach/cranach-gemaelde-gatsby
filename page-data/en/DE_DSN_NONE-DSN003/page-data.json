The panel was created for the cathedral in Zeitz. Possible commissioners are Bishop Johannes III. of Schönberg (1492 -1517) and Philipp of Wittelsbach (1517 -1541). […]\nThe image of the Saviour was it seems particularly popular in Zeitz and Naumburg, but this requires a specific study.  The motif of the Saviour requires a special explanation. It was widespread in 15th century Venice. Its background leads us to the Flanders, where both van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden created bust images. Artists in Venice who painted the subject are Antonello da Messina, Giovanni Bellini, Andrea Previtali (two paintings in London), Cima da Conegliano and Jacopo de’Barbari, who as is well known worked alongside Cranach in Wittenberg. \nIn Cranach’s work it can be compared with the series of woodcuts ‚Heiland mit den Aposteln’. There is no comparable example among larger paintings with the distinction like here between the body and the coat, between the standing and the free leg and between the angled, raised right hand and the lower left hand.  Even the well resolved detail of the (frontally positioned) cross on the globe in the woodcut has been twisted to create an alarming perspective. The reason for such severe alterations is presumably that all other gestures and signs in the painting were subdued for the sake of a direct relationship with the viewer. That would explain the hand sinking in blessing and the inclusion of the globe in the cumbersome outline. It stands to reason that one might reflect the influence of formulations like those Nikolaus von Cues, and perhaps others before him, may have committed to paper, that is to say: 'You see me, but my eyes follow you continuously to every location of your stay'. (Ihr seht mich, aber meine Augen verfolgen Euch immerwährend zu jedem Ort Eures Aufenthaltes.)\n\n[Schade, in Kunde 2006, 137]","year":2006}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1510,"dated":"about 1515 - 1516","end":1521,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Domstift Naumburg, revised 2014]\n[Schade, Kunde 2006, 137]\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 78]\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, No. 71]"},"description":"Christ stands larger than life-sized on a narrow strip of ground against a light blue background. His right hand is raised in an attitude of blessing and he holds a globe crowned with a cross in his left hand. A further coat falls off his shoulders providing a powerful elaboration to animate the broad gold braid. The insides of the deep sleeves stand out against the mass of drapery blazing yellowish red. The stiff robe of gold and silk defines the figure with simple outlines. \nThe feet indicate a precarious stance similar to the figure of Judas Thaddaeus in Cranach's series of woodcuts of the apostles. The central axis is left by a slight inclination of the head. The low-angle view of the face, anticipated given the size of the figure, is thus countered. The enormous figure appears almost to sway. \nBy enlarging all forms the resulting head height measures 32.5 cm and the face appears unusually broad. Striking are the eye openings, which make the face appear frozen. However the eyes are painted in Cranach's usual technique, remote from the crudity of some workshop paintings. The beard is also executed with subtlety. Apart from these barely perceptible gems single sections of the braid with its pearls and precious stones as well as the freely painted ornamentation are to be admired. The formation of the halo around the head is unusual and may be the result of later reworking. However there is a woodcut by Cranach illustrating a halo of a similar shape.\n\n[Schade, in Kunde 2006, 137, 139]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 224 x 110 cm \n[Schade, in Kunde 2006,
