He is gently supported by the seated female figures, framing him in a triangle. The Virgin is at the apex, her head tilted slightly to her right and her hair worn loose. St Catharine is shown on the left and is identified by the hilt of a sword, while the woman on the right is probably St Barbara. The figurative group is set in front of a curtain held at either corner by a cherub. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 60 × 40 cm\n[Photocopy of a page from the auction catalogue H.
