She is naked except for a wisp of transparent gauze that she stretches across her midriff, a necklace (a simple band with a single pearl drop), and a beret-like hat with three short plumes. She is seen from the left; her head inclined downwards and to the proper right; her eyes looking at the viewer; her right hand raised, her left by her left thigh. To the left, the naked figure of a winged infant (Cupid), holds up a honeycomb to Venus, to whom he looks up; his body is dotted with bees. To the right, the recumbent head and forelegs of a deer.
