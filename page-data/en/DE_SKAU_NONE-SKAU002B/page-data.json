The wooden construction, which is 1.20 m in height, is mounted on a solid projecting stone at a height of c. 2.20 m. The left side of the pulpit with the entrance is shaped like a semi-circle whereas the right side with the lectern is rectangular. \nThe pulpit is decorated with six illustrations of the Life of the Virgin as well as the Life and Passion of Christ. Each scene is separated by a carved pilaster showing Hermes. \nAbove the paintings there is a carved friese, 34 cm in height, depicting putti in tunics recalling Roman legionary uniforms alternating with different coats-of-arms. In the background green tendrils with predominantly red fruit have been painted behind the carving. There is a wooden base of 14 cms in height with a carved geometric decoration beneath the paintings, which finishes with a profiled batten. Above the pulpit is an abat-voix, which is decorated on the underside with a depiction of the Trinity on a gilded ground. This depiction is surrounded by angels on a blue background, holding the instruments of martyrdom. The painting is framed by a carved egg and dart ornamentation. The top of the abat-voix is decorated with a crown.\nThe six pulpit paintings illustrate - from left to right - the following subjects:\nThe Annunciation, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Baptism of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection. The lectern is located above the Crucifixion. \n \n[Herrschaft 2013, 18-19]","year":2013},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Iconography:\nIn the late middle ages the depiction of the Nativity had already been superceded by the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Magi as well as the Virgin. The scene with the Adoration of the Shepherds is not mentioned in the gospels. \nThe setting is usually a stable or a ruin. The depiction is usually completed among others - like here - with the annunciation of the shepherds in the background. Although not mentioned in the gospels the ox and the ass are included in the earliest depictions as representatives of judaism and paganism. \nThe composition of the painting in Augustusburg is very similar to the so-called Christmas Epitaph (Wittenberg parish church, 1564): a crib with the baby Jesus is positioned in the centre foreground and observed by the kneeling Virgin and Joseph who stands. Three shepherds also enter from the right in this painting, equipped with crooks and bagpipes. One of them removes his hat. Again the ox and ass are shown on the left. In the background a window opens onto a winterlandscape in which the annunciation of the shepherds is shown. Putti romp about under the ceiling. These were less numerous in the earlier work. However in the Augustusburg painting the motif of the winterlandscape, illustrated in the Wittenberg painting, has been abandoned.\nWith the composition of the adoration of the naked baby Jesus by the Virgin in the company of small angels Lucas Cranach the Younger has complied with the standard formula used in the workshop during his father's lifetime. However earlier works following this pattern keep the shepherds in the background, for example in The Nativity (about 1515) in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden and other versions created about 1515-1520 in the same collection as well as The Holy Night (after 1537) in the Angermuseum in Erfurt. \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 24]","year":2013}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1573,"dated":"1573","end":1573,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Crucifixion dated]"},"description":"In a stone stable surrounded by hay and straw the baby Jesus lies naked on a box of straw bedded on a white cloth. He is encircled by a subtle gloriole of gold. On the left side of the painting the Virgin kneels enveloped in a blue cloak with her hands held in an attitude of prayer. Her head, which is covered by an almost transparent veil, is encircled by a delicate halo. Joseph stands beside her in a half-length red coat, holding his hat in front of his chest. Three shepherds enter from the right through an arched door. Two of them look at the baby Jesus. The first one to enter carries a bagpipe and has removed his hat out of respect, but rather than looking at Jesus he looks at the viewer as if prompting him to do the same. Opposite the shepherds on the left side an ox and donkey are visible. An opening in the wall behind reveals a view of a landscape in which the angel who announced the arrival of the redeemer to the three shepherds is shown. The landscape takes up only a small part of the background as the left upper section of the painting is occupied by a throng of angels in a cloud. \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 20]","dimensions":"Dimensions

On all the panels the paint layers extend to the edge at the sides - like the ground - whereas the paint layers at the top and bottom end before the ground. \nBy and large all the panels exhibit a very economic painting technique with a thin application of paint, which nevertheless is predominantly opaque. In addition there are areas of glazed colour, where the imprimatura is occasionally visible and influences the colour scheme of the panel. \nThe quality of the painting is very mixed and reveals the cooperation of more than one person on each panel. Many of the affectionately executed details are only visible close up, which considering the position of the panels 2 meters above is never possible. Other areas are less precise and occasionally unfinished (this is also the case for the decorative painting on the pulpit).\n \nThe Virgin's robe was initially painted in red (vermilion) and the contours and shadow were added in dark red glazes. The decolleté and the hem of the sleeve were finished with very filigrane golden decoration. The Virgin's cloak was initially painted in blue (azurite mixed with lead white). The arrangement of the folds and highlights were applied in white and the shadows in black. The hem was then decorated with a thin gold line. \n\nJoseph's coat was also initially painted in red and the folds and highlights in white. Subsequently the contours and the shadows were added with a dark red glaze. \nA vermilion and lead white admixture was employed for both the coats of Joseph and the Virgin. \nThe dark green lining of the farmer's overcoat was painted employing verdigris mixed with earth pigments (ochre). \nThe yellow garments of the farmer (stockings, shoulder cloak) were painted employing lead-tin yellow. \nThe faces, the hair and the hands of the figures were painted in great detail with different facial expressions. Apart from the rosy cheeks and lips the Virgin's face was predominantly executed in light grey tones with white highlights. The flesh paint of the male faces, the baby Jesus and the hands was initially painted brown, followed by shadows in a subtle grey. Subsequently the highlights were added in a lighter flesh-colour. Occasionally contours were added in brown, for example Joseph's nose and the thigh of the baby Jesus. Otherwise such outlines are limited to the execution of the eyes and some mouths.\nThe head and beard hair was executed initially in a flat base tone over which fine hairs in a lighter paint were added. Single strands were also applied in a darker paint. \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 50 – 52]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["10_Analysis/DE_SKAU_NONE-SKAU002B_2013-05_Analysis-report.pdf"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Jana Herrschaft","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"05. 2013","endDate":"05. 2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"05.
