His face, framed by a beard and receding grayish brown hair, is turned to the right. He has folded his hands in front of him and is wearing a rather simple black coat buttoned below the neck. A white shirt with a high collar is visible beneath as are the chains around his neck. These are decorated with two pendants one appears to be a small vessel, the other a drinking mug, bearing a male portrait. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 52 x 36 cm\n[Lost Art online database: http://www.lostart.de/DE/Verlust/419892;
