Smalt was probably used in the underpaint, and subsequently the final layer was applied using an admixture of azurite and lead white.\n\nIn the Jäger's laboratory red lead was also identified.\n\nThe background was applied in two layers (see above); the greyish underpaint was applied with a broad brush.\n\nThe modulation of the flesh paint was achieved by dabbing the paint on.\n\nIndividual forms are clearly defined and executed with little overlapping. Only minor corrections were made to the composition \n\n\n\n\nThe pigments identified here were in common use in European panel painting before 1750 and were also used in the Cranach workshop. However while Lucas Cranach the Elder usually employed azurite as a blue pigment his son Lucas Cranach the Younger preferred to use smalt. \n\n\nThe technique for applying paint (dabbing) corresponds with the general practice in the Cranach workshop. The forms and design elements are also found on other works from the Cranach workshop from the 1540s. However the execution of details in this work like the eyes and the hair as well as the application of the flesh paint differ from those found on verified works by Lucas Cranach the Elder. \n\n\n[unpublished examination report, G.
