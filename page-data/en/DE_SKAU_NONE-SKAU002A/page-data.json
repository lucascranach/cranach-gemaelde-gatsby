Although the Annunciation scene continues to appear in both catholic and protestant art after the reformation there is no example of the subject in the  catalogue raisonné of Cranach the Elder's work published in 1979. However a woodcut by Cranach the Elder from 1511, illustrating the annunciation, was published by Schade in 1974, but it exhibits no similarities with the painting in Augustusburg.\nThe position and pose of the Archangel is similar to the Annunciation on the right wing (exterior) of the Colditz Altar from 1584. The composition of this work cannot be compared with that of the pulpit painting in the Augustusburg. \nThe so-called Christmas Epitaph (Epitaph Niemekg) in the parish church of Wittenberg seems to have served as a prototype for the positioning of the Virgin's arms. \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 24]","year":2013},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"The pulpit is located on the central pillar at the east side of the south facing chapel.

The left side of the pulpit with the entrance is shaped like a semi-circle whereas the right side with the lectern is rectangular. \nThe pulpit is decorated with six illustrations of the Life of the Virgin as well as the Life and Passion of Christ. Each scene is separated by a carved pilaster showing Hermes. \nAbove the paintings there is a carved friese, 34 cm in height, depicting putti in tunics recalling Roman legionary uniforms alternating with different coats-of-arms. In the background green tendrils with predominantly red fruit have been painted behind the carving. There is a wooden base of 14 cms in height with a carved geometric decoration beneath the paintings, which finishes with a profiled batten. Above the pulpit is an abat-voix, which is decorated on the underside with a depiction of the Trinity on a gilded ground. This depiction is surrounded by angels on a blue background, holding the instruments of martyrdom. The painting is framed by a carved egg and dart ornamentation. The top of the abat-voix is decorated with a crown.\nThe six pulpit paintings illustrate - from left to right - the following subjects:\nThe Annunciation, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Baptism of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection.

Behind the figures there is a green curtain on the right and on the left there is a bench. In the centre of the wall a window reveals a view of a landscape.

In addition there are areas of glazed colour, where the imprimatura is occasionally visible and influences the colour scheme of the panel. \nThe quality of the painting is very mixed and reveals the cooperation of more than one person on each panel. Many of the affectionately executed details are only visible close up, which considering the position of the panels 2 meters above is never possible. Other areas are less precise and occasionally unfinished (this is also the case for the decorative painting on the pulpit).\nThe Virgin's cloak was executed with smalt and the arrangement of the folds was applied with white lines. The archangel's dalmatic was executed in red paint on a light ground, light areas were applied as a glaze and a more opaque application was employed for the shadows. The arrangement of the folds was indicated with pale yellow lines before the floral ornamentation was applied in green paint. To conclude short yellow strokes were applied in the lighter areas to simulate the modelling of the brocade. \nFor the alba and the amice - like the Virgin's robe - the folds were indicated with a red lake over a pale pink ground.\nThe red cushion in the interior contains vermilion, which was subsequently covered by a red lake glaze.\nThe verdigris employed for the curtain was mixed with some black and ochre.  \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 46-49]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["10_Analysis/DE_SKAU_NONE-SKAU002A_2013-05_Analysis-report.pdf"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Jana Herrschaft","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"05. 2013","endDate":"05. 2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"05.
