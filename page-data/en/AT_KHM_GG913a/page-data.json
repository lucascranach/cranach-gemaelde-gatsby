The uniform background and the inscriptions indicate that the paintings are pendants, and that they perhaps served as the inner wings of a small altarpiece, which no longer exists. \n \nIconography: St Jerome is shown as a single figure healing the lion: the animal seeks his assistance and he pulls a thorn out of its paw.[1] The unusual position of the animal is similar to that in representations which would have been familiar to Cranach, for example the rendition of a silver reliquary statue in the ‚Wittenberg Heiligtumsbuch‘ or a large panel with saints in Aschaffenburg.[2]\n \nResearch History: The small images of the saints from the clerical treasury have been a permanent fixture in the first room of the Early German School since the earliest installation of the Imperial Picture Gallery in the Belvedere.[3] The clearly legible characters of the signature and the date were already observed by Schuchardt and were taken as a point of reference for further research: he noted an orientation towards Dürer, which may be accounted for by the cooperation on the drawings in the margin of Emperor Maximilian’s prayer book in the same year.[4] Hereafter it was repeatedly pointed out that early dated paintings by Cranach, like the ones discussed here, are rare.[5] The catalogue entry from 1928 suspects, with reference to the concurrent work for Emperor Maximilian’s prayer book, that the winged altarpiece was commissioned by an Austrian because of the depiction of St Leopold.[6] Schade suggests that it could have been a present from Friedrich the Wise to Emperor Maximilian. He refers to a representation of a silver statue of St Jerome in the Wittenberg Heiltumsbuch from 1509 as an exemplary depiction of the saint: inverted but the position of the lion is identical.[7] The representation of St Leopold was evidently not among Cranach’s repertoire of forms as was observed in the catalogue of the Lower Austrian Landesausstellung from 1983: the ducal hat and the cloak differ from the prevaling depictions of the saint at that time.[8] \nWhereas the gallery catalogue from 1928 and later publications by the museum classify the panels as ‚autographic‘ paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Schade remarked that they were less meticulously executed panels from the Cranach workshop.[9]\n \nDiscussion:\nBoth panels have been preserved in their original size but the original frame was lost at some unknown date. On the panels there is no indication of the original assembly and consequently the designated use. The reverse of both panels exhibit a very old possibly original black coating. This side was presumably not intended for viewing, as it would otherwise feature marbling or some other embellishment. Therefore it remains open whether the panels served as wings of a small altar or whether they had another function.\n[Tüchler, Hoppe-Harnoncourt, Kunsthistorisches Museum, 2013][Translation, Smith, cda 2013]\n\n\n\n\n[1] LCI (Lexikon Christlicher Ikonographie), Bd. 6, 1974, Sp. 521.\n[2] Jahn, Johannes: Lucas Cranach d.

The flesh paint was modeled with a few impasto details over a semitransparent base tone, so that the ground participates in the visual effect. Occasionally the ground has not been covered with paint in the spaces in between or is visible through the thinly applied flesh paint. White highlights were applied with visible brushstrokes to the flesh paint once dry, the contours of the facial features like the nostrils and bridge of the nose and the fingers were drawn in a diluted brown paint (Fig. 003).\n \nCranach’s rapid painting technique can be seen in the areas applied wet-in-wet like for example the crossing hairs in the beard. The drapery folds were also drawn together with a quick succession of light and dark paint applications while the paint was still wet, the highlights were created with single, impasto brushstrokes (Fig. 004). Fine hairs on the back of the right hand were painted into the wet highlight (Fig. 005). \n \nCranach achieved desired effects by deliberately drawing different tones together with the brush while the paint was still wet. St Jerome‘s light eyelashes were drawn through the dark wet paint of the eye (Fig. 006) and the light claws of the lion were drawn through the dark paint of the fur and in this manner mixed first on the support to grey (Fig. 007).\n \nA particular stylistic effect can be observed on St Jerome’s light hem, where the white paint application was dabbed on with a stubbed brush and the imprint has remained in the paint (Fig. 008). \nA further deliberate effect was employed for the paint application of the lion’s dark fur, apparently here a lean paint was deliberately used, thus lending the brushstrokes a ‚broken/friable character (Fig. 009).   \nThe halos are not gilded, but are rather executed in yellow paint. \nThe designation of the saint was applied in thick yellow paint at the top edge of the painting on the background (Fig. 010), date and signature (a serpent with elevated wings facing left) is on the pendant piece St Leopold (913b)."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"new frame\n[Tüchler, Kunsthistorisches Museum, 2013][Translation, Smith, cda 2013]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The infrared reflectogram of both paintings reveals diluted, fluid underdrawing lines executed with a lively brush – mainly for the contours. Short, distinct lines sketch the facial features like eyebrows, ear and single curls in the beard. The underdrawing appears to be a very free indication rather than a meticulous designation as the painted version exhibits some deviations from the underdrawing like the position of the eyes and the paw of the lion.
