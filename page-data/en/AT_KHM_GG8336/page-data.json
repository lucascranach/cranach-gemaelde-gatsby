With both hands she plunges the dagger into her body below her right breast. Streams of blood run from the wound. Her head is turned to the right and slightly inclined. The expression on her face reveals the pain she has inflicted upon herself. Her long hair falls in single strands over her shoulders and frames a large linked chain, which she wears together with a neck collar set with precious stones. \n[Görres, cda 2012]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 80 x 50 cm (bottom edge trimmed)\n[Exhib.
