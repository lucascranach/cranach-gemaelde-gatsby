The sitter is Anna Cuspinian (formerly Putsch) the daughter of the royal treasurer Ulrich Putsch. The continuous landscape into which the sitters have been placed is only divided by the frame and thus supports the theory that both portraits were conceived as a unit. The original frame was probably hinged so that it could be closed or propped upright and did not necessarily hang on the wall.  Various elements subtly convey both Christian and humanistic symbolic meaning, some alluding to love and wedlock.'In den Worten von Ernst Buchner'Der frühlingshafte Zauber eines neuen Weltzeitalters liegt über den Tafeln.'

It may be concluded from the rings visible in the x-radiograph that both panels of the diptych are from the same plank. The top edge of the panel depicting Anna Cuspinian can be matched with the bottom edge of the panel depicting Johannes. Numerous knots have been preserved in the wood. On the reverse beneath the branding mark is an original wooden insert (c. 8 x 1.5 cm). The reverse of the panel has been smoothed with a plane in the direction of the grain (the plane marks are up to 3 cms wide) and fibres (flax tow) have been applied locally. The wooden insert is also covered with fibres. \nThe edge of the panel has been slightly bevelled/chamfered on the reverse along all sides (a width of c. 1 cm). As the burr of the ground runs directly along the left side of the panel and the bevel is not present it can be assumed that the panel has been cropped slightly at a later stage (c. 4 mm). There are indentations around the edge of the panel on all four sides, which are probably due to a previous framing system. On the reverse of the panel a black and subsequent light green coating can be identified. The black coating could be original. The green coating is clearly visible in the x-radiograph and may contain lead white. \n\nComment:\nThe species of wood and the woodwork are the same as the diptych depicting a portrait of the Viennese Lawyer and his wife (1503, FR 8, 9) and thus suggest that they were created during the same period and are of the same geographic origin.

The mordant for the matt gilding is pigmented grey/brown. The gilding on the bonnet and the corset was carried out after the first layer of flesh paint was applied, subsequently the contours were corrected with flesh paint. \n\nPaint Layers:\nThe initial layer of the flesh paint is a pinkish dead colouring. It is a rather flat application predominantly in the vertical direction. The subsequent modelling of the facial features was carried out with light pink admixtures (cheeks, forehead and the bridge of the nose) and brown glazes in the areas of shadow. Contours are drawn in brown paint. Small amounts of blue pigment were identified in the half tones.\nIn the x-radiograph the face appears to be executed with a degree of fluidity and exhibits a relatively weak absorption profile (reflects the lighting situation rather than the facial features). Obvious brushstrokes are only visible in the area of the forehead. The eyeballs are painted bluish white; the iris blue and the pupils are black without reflections. The contours of the pink eyelids, below the eyes and individual eyelashes are described with brown to blackish paint. A flat application of brown paint is employed to depict the eyebrows. The lips are modelled in vermilion mixed with white, the shadow on the upper lip appears to be achieved with red lake and a brown line separates the upper and lower lips.\n\nThe sky was initially painted with a violet to grey admixture containing fluorite and lead white (EDX). This grey underpainting was lightened to white along the horizon. The blue paint was dabbed on with a brush while holding both the foliage and the bonnet in reserve. Microscopic examination suggests that the blue pigment is azurite.\n\n  \n\nThe sitter's red brocade robe was initially modelled employing light red (admixtures of a red pigment and lead white), while the depth of shadow in the folds was achieved with red lake. The pattern on the brocade although partially described in red lake is predominantly carried out with white admixtures over which followed a red lake glaze. The corset is created by employing various coloured glazes (green, red and brown)and lead white over gold coloured metal leaf. The white blouse is painted with varying ratios of lead white and blue pigment. \n\nThe landscape in the background was carried out after the red robe. An initial flat application of dark green paint was applied to establish the basic form of the foliage. On top of this a lighter green tone was employed to define single groups of leaves, which were then modulated with a green glaze. This glaze now has a slight brownish appearance, particularly along the edge of the craquellee (similar discolouring is not visible in the green glaze of the corset). \n\n[see 1995 CA10 (Dr Gunnar Heydenreich)]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Peter Klein","role":"analysed by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"29.03.1998","endDate":"29.03.1998"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"23.
