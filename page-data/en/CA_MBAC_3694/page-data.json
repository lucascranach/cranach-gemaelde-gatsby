With these words Jesus rebukes the men who have gathered to demand that he condemn her and sanction her death. The punishment for adultery was death by stoning, and the man in armour already grasps a rock. The figures press inward - a jumble of expressive faces and glances, with the accusers to the left and Christ's disciples to the right. Jesus, who holds the woman's arm in a protective gesture, is the calm centre of the tumult. A celebration of divine mercy, this was a favourite subject, and Cranach and his workshop painted many variations on it. \n[National Gallery of Canada, revised 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 84 x 118 cm\n[National Gallery of Canada, revised 2017]","exhibitionHistory":"Leeds, City Art Gallery 1868, no. 510\nLondon, Savile Gallery 1929, no. 10\nCambridge (Mass.) 1936, no. 104 [?]","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":10605,"height":7527}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":142},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365/01_Overall/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365_2017_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":284},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365/01_Overall/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365_2017_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":426},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365/01_Overall/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365_2017_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365/01_Overall/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365_2017_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365/01_Overall/CA_MBAC_3694_FR365_2017_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"CA_MBAC_3694","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[National Gallery of Canada, revised 2017][Cat.
