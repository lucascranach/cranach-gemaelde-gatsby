In this tradition, the woman is presented as a dangerous creature, a source of sin, humiliation, perdition and death. The theme, the origins of which date from the Middle Ages, was subsequently reformulated and led to a host of variations. This particular version depicts the couple alone, against a plain background that gives no indication of where the action is taking place: an imprudent old man, thoroughly captivated by female charms. The theme of the ill-matched couple was one of Lucas Cranach's favourites, and was frequently copied by his contemporaries and followers.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:  44.7 x 49.8 cm\n[Exhib.
