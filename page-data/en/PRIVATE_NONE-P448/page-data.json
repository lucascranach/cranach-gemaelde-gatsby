Venus looks out at the viewer, wearing only a transparent veil, which seems to emphasize her nakedness rather than conceal it. Her weight is supported on her right leg and she has turned slightly towards Cupid. He is already holding a honeycomb in his left hand, while pulling another out of the tree with his right hand. Bees swarm about him and he looks to Venus for assistance. The Latin inscription in the upper left corner suggests that the motif wishes to alert the viewer to the consequences of abandoned lust.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 52.5 x 37 cm\n[Howard 2009, 16]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1474,"height":2116}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":287},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":574},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":861},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1474,"height":2116},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- in the upper left corner:\n'DVM PVER ALVEOLO FVRATVR MELLA CVPIDO // FVRANTI DIGITVM CVSPITE FIXIT APIS // SIC ETIA (~) NOBIS BREVIS ET PERITVRA VOLVPTAS // QVAM PETIMVS [TRIS]TI MIXTA DOLORE NOCET.'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P448","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Koepplin 2003 B, 47, 130; Howard 2009, 5]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Howard 2009, 16]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 52.5 x 37 cm\n[Howard 2009, 16]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1532","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P448","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Venus and  Cupid as the Honey Thief"},"objectId":985986,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- sold by Colnaghi, London\n- private collection, 2009\n[Howard 2009, 16]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"4, 5, 16","referenceId":"30418","title":"Howard 2009"},{"pageNumber":"47, [130]","referenceId":"434","title":"Koepplin 2003 B"}],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"Artist's insignia on the trunk of the tree: serpent with elevated wings, facing right and dated '1532'; in yellow paint","sortingNumber":"1532-032-81","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"52.50","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Venus and  Cupid as the Honey Thief","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":287},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":574},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":861},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1474,"height":2116},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P448_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
