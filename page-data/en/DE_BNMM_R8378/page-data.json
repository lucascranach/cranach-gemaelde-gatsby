White fabric decorated with braids puffs out at the elbows and shoulders of the dress. The deep neckline directs our eye the two sumptuous chains worn by Salome. It is worth remarking that the chain set with precious stones does not appear to be affected by the prominent cast shadow on the neck. Salome's rosy cheeks are framed by long curly strands of brown hair, which is for the greater part are concealed by an elaborately embellished snood. The beauty of the woman is juxtaposed with the horrific vision of the St John's severed head, which she holds on a plate.  The direction in which the protagonists gaze is orchestrated to augment this effect: Whereas Salome looks into the distance the half-open eyes of the decapitated St John appear to look directly at the viewer.\n[Görres, cda 2017]","dimensions":"DImensions of support: 72.5 x 54.3 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 32]","exhibitionHistory":"Berlin 1937, no. 21","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2329,"height":2968}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":268},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":535},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":803},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2100,"height":2810},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":255},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":510},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":765},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2329,"height":2968},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032/01_Overall/DE_BNMM_R8378_FR032_2001_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_BNMM_R8378","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 32] [Exhib.
