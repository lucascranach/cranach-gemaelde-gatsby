This is a rare case whereby both the preparatory drawing and the panel have survived. The conflict experienced in the relationship with his father proved to be formative for Martin Luther. Cranach has slightly tempered the features described above for posterity in the painted version. But the study reveals the sitter’s character to be informed by remoteness, denial and defeatism and is at the same time one of the greatest achievements of German portraiture. \n[Metzger, Exhib. Cat.

His gaze, in fact his whole face, is turned to the right in the direction of a hidden counterpart. The artist deliberately chose paper of an intense brown tonality to reinforce the vibrant complexion of the flesh paint. Cranach differentiates with an accomplished command of technique between the detailed rendering of the face and the sketchy, sparse brushwork of the doublet. \n[Metzger, Exhib. Cat.
