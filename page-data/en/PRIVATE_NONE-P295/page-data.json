The hair of the infant Christ was executed, using a brown glaze over a grey underpaint, subsequently a few yellow and some black hair strands were applied in relatively broad lines. \n\nThe x-radiograph shows that the painting process was carried out with few corrections: individual forms were clearly defined with little overlapping. Only in the figure of the infant Christ can minor corrections be observed where his toes were made shorter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of grey values in the infrared reflectogram (which is partially related to the use of carbon black) differ from those found on authentic works from the Cranach workshop. The x-radiography also differs considerably from those of verified Cranach paintings. \n\n\nThe pigments identified were used frequently in European painting before 1750, and also in the Cranach workshop. However, as yet no other example of a grey underpaint containing large white particles is known from the Cranach workshop. The use of azurite in the dark grey background is also unusual. There is also a considerable discrepancy between the quality of this work and that of verified Cranach paintings.
