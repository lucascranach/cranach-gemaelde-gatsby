His face has a light brown complexion, while his gaze is directed obliquely upwards. His hair is grey with unkempt curls that cover his forehead. The gown appears today as a monotone black, originally the angled collar continued down to the bottom. The white shirt visible at the neckline is bound with a black cord, beneath which there is a red braid.  \n[Cat. Münster 1990, No. 232]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 34 x 26.5 cm\n[Cat.
