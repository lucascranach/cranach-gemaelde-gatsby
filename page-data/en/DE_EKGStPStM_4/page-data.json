Similarly the scene of ‘The Brazen Serpent' integrated into the landscape provides a prototype for the sacrifice made  for man's salvation and the resurrection. Ribestein probably drew on Early Netherlandish iconographic tradition for this landscape charged with salvation-historical motifs, like Joachim Patinirs. However, the landscape and the tonality also show parallels with contemporary Dutch and Flemish art (The Crucifixion, Marten de Vos, in Celle Castle) and a direct influence may be assumed. \n[Maria Dieters, Exhib.

The painting draws on motifs from an earlier epitaph by Ribestein (the so-called Reiche-Epitaph) and varies them. In the earlier work it is the inscription that enables us to interpret the Crucifixion within the context of Luther's doctrine of Law and Grace, whereas in the present panel the large figures of Moses and St John beneath the cross as well as the scenes in the background serve this purpose. In both paintings the cross, which is central to Christian faith is shifted to the front edge of the painting. [...] On this panel the frontal depiction of Christ with open eyes shows him triumphant over death.\nIt is striking that Ribestein abandons the medieval conventions  of the epitaph painting and places the donor family behind the cross and as such removes them the material world. This alone is enough to indicate that the landscape is more than a mere backdrop.  \n[Maria Dieters, Exhib. Cat.
