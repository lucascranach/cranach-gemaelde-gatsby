As stated in the inscription on the epitaph he was buried a year later in the choir and his heirs Joachim Ernst and Bernhard of Anhalt commissioned the epitaph painting. According to the inscription it was hung close to the tomb, later its position was changed many times and it now hangs on the north wall of the choir. \nDuring the transition to Calvinism numerous painted panels were removed from the Church of St Bartholomew, but not Wolfgang’s epitaph. Admittedly representations of him were largely rejected, which culminated in 1662 with the superintendent’s urgent demand to have the ‚nackende Baderbild‘(image of naked bathers) removed from the church (Wiemann 1907, 68), nevertheless it remained in the church. Only the painted panel has survived from the original epitaph. The inscription was recorded by Wiemann (Wiemann 1907, 69f.). Thanks to a photograph take in 1927 the original presentation is also recorded: a wooden frame with sixteen elements showing proof of ancestry, and beneath the panel with the inscription, now lost. […]\nThe inclusion of the Lutheran theologian makes clear reference to the Wittenberg reformation, and is reinforced by the vedute showing Wittenberg, indicating the origin of the new faith. Wolfgang of Anhalt encouraged reformation thought in Zerbst at an early stage, between 1522 and 1524. He was committed early on to the reformation, signing the Confessio Augustana in 1529 at the Reichstag in Speyer and he was one of the founding members of the Schmalkaldic League. As early as 1526 he was affiliated to the Protestant Union in Gotha and in the same year he establish the reformation in Bernburg, before all other parts of Anhalt under his rule followed. \n[Wulf 2016, Kat.nr.

Standing at the right edge of the painting is Christ wearing a loincloth, looking directly at the viewer and holding his hands in an attitude of prayer. St John the Baptist stands behind in the river. He wears the typical fur robe and is identified by his considerably darker skin. St John has scooped up a bowl of water from the Jordan and pours it over Christ's head. The Holy Ghost, who has been sent by God the Father from an auriole framed by clouds, hovers over Christ in the shape of a dove. A large number of angels with trombones enliven the clear sky.\nThe deceased (1566) Duke Wolfgang of Anhalt, to whom this epitaph is dedicated,  kneels in the left corner close to the edge of the painting and opposite the baptism scene. He wears a splendid fur-trimmed coat over a black robe as well as a triple chained gold necklace with a portrait medallion bearing an inscription. His grey beard is cut straight across beneath the chin.\nIsolated figurative groups have gathered on different islands in the background landscape. Between Wolfgang and the Baptist male representatives of the Anhalt family are visible, in the first row Wolfgang's cousin Georg III., Johann IV. and Joachim I., the sons of Johann IV appear to be represented behind to the left. Joachim Ernst of Anhalt can be identified in the centre, possibly flanked by his brothers Karl and Bernhard VII.\nBehind the baptism scene in the middle-ground is a large group of reformers and scholars, in the front Luther and Melanchthon. Johann Forster can also be identified in this group.\nFinally in the background women and children are depicted who probably represent members of the Anhalt house and their more distant relatives.  A veduta is visible on the horizon, which appears to be a representation of Wittenberg. \n[Görres, cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of visible surface 274 x 203.5 cm\nDimensions including frame:
