However here unlike many other versions it is not the large age gap between the figures that is addressed by the image.

She is shown holding her hands out in expectation to receive the money he pulls from his purse. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 37.5 x 24.5 cm\n[Letter from Van Ham, Cologne to D.
