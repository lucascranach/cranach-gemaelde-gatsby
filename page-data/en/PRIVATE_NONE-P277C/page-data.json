The triptych may be a work by Veit Thiem, one of Franz Thim’s sons; he was a pupil or an apprentice in Lucas Cranach the Younger’s workshop. It would seem reasonable to assume that Veit Thiem painted the epitaph for his father himself. The central panel already belonged to the family before Franz Thiem passed away, whereas the wing panels were commissioned about 1570, after the death of the wife and mother, by the children to create an epitaph for their parents.
