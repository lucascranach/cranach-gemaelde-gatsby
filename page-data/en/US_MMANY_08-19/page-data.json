Hans,”[3] and the Latin inscription on a likeness by Monogrammist I.S. describes him precisely as “Johann, Duke of Saxony, son of Georg” (fig. 60).[4]\nThe attribution of this portrait has received only cursory discussion. Upon its initial publication by Christian Schuchardt in 1851, it was included among the works of Lucas Cranach the Elder, and most references to the painting retain that attribution.[5] In their catalogue raisonné of Cranach’s paintings, however, Max J. Friedländer and Jakob Rosenberg tentatively ascribed it to Lucas Cranach the Younger, presumably because they perceived in it the “empty grandeur, . . . pallid tones and . . . feeble plasticity” described by Friedländer as characteristic of the son’s work.[6] Their dating of the painting after 1537 accords with the hypothesis, advanced provisionally by Friedländer, that the father had mostly withdrawn from managing the workshop by that time, leaving his son in charge — a notion that recent documentary evidence refutes.[7] Friedländer and Rosenberg also noted the existence of a bust-length version in private ownership (now in the Staatsgalerie Aschaffenburg).[8] Heinrich Zimmermann implicitly upheld the suggested attribution of Friedländer and Rosenberg by likening the Metropolitan’s portrait stylistically to a sketch in Rheims that he considered a work of Lucas Cranach the Younger.[9] Zimmermann dated the Museum’s portrait about 1537 and proposed that it might have been painted posthumously as a memorial image.\nThose traditional stylistic assessments, which imply a certain inferiority in quality, fail to consider how the painting’s condition adversely affects its appearance. The already thin layering of paint in the flesh areas was strongly abraded in past cleanings; also, the inner modeling of the costume has faded into a largely undifferentiated field of black. Both aspects of the condition increase the work’s overall impression of flatness and stiffness, factors that surely contributed to the tentative attribution to Lucas Cranach the Younger.\nIn style and technique this work is consistent with other portraits by Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop. As a member of the studio, Lucas the Younger could well have had some involvement, but the painting does not display characteristic features, such as a dominant paleness in the flesh tones, that would justify distinguishing it as by his hand, as is possible with a few works of the1530s and with greater frequency in the 1540s.[10] The modeling of the flesh in fact appears typical of a process used by the father, in which sparing applications of pinks and whites were laid over a thin base flesh color and in which shadows were established with dilute glazes of black pigments.[11] A similar approach can be observed, for example, in the Museum’s Portrait of a Man with a Gold-Embroidered Cap of 1532 (cat. 14). Moreover, X-radiographs of both works reveal a similar buildup of paint in the faces, including the prominent stroke along the bottom edge of the lower lip (figs. 57, 61).[12] The X-radiograph of Johann’s portrait also shows that the base tone of the hands was brushed on loosely, beyond its visible contours in normal light; the final silhouette was defined only during the painting of the surrounding black costume, which overlaps the flesh tone. This time-saving technique, which occurs frequently in Cranach’s oeuvre, appears also in the hands in the Museum’s 1532 portrait.[13]\nA particularly clear example of this procedure is found in the Metropolitan’s Venus and Cupid roundel, where it is used for the whole figure (fig. 46).\nA specification of the portrait’s date is offered by Lucas Cranach the Elder’s strikingly similar Georg the Bearded of 1534 or 1535, now in Leipzig (fig. 62).[14] The dimensions, placement of the figure, and cast shadow are all closely comparable; only the blue background color is different.[15] As a portrait of Johann’s father, the Leipzig panel may well have provided a model for the size and design of the present portrait. It also establishes a plausible earliest execution date of 1534 for the latter. That date is consistent with the style of the painting and the mature appearance of the sitter. Furthermore, 1534 is the year when cast shadows suddenly occur in several other works by Cranach and his workshop, including the only signed portrait by Cranach’s elder son, Hans.[16] The artist’s rare use of a red background is documented among this 1534 group in the Staatsgalerie Bamberg’s Christiane von Eulenau, which has been attributed variously to Lucas the Younger and Lucas the Elder.[17]\nFurther evidence for dating is offered by the panel support, which is of beech wood. Dendrochronological research has shown that beech was used with greatest frequency by the Cranach workshop between 1522 and 1535, with some later occurrences.[18] Although the present panel is not currently datable with dendrochronology, the use of beech nevertheless suggests, even if tentatively, a date not considerably later than the mid-1530s.\nThe combined evidence thus supports a plausible date range of 1534 to about 1537, the year of Johann’s death. Whether this work was indeed painted as a posthumous memorial, as Zimmermann suggested, cannot be ruled out, but the idea is not necessarily supported by the representation itself and therefore remains highly speculative.\n \n[1] The sitter was correctly identified when the painting was first published (Schuchardt 1851 – 71, vol. 2 [1851], p. 88, no. 340), but this was forgotten by the time the Museum acquired the picture in 1908, and only rediscovered and reaffirmed in Friedländer and J.

The panel was very likely thinned and strips of wood were attached to the top and bottom of the panel. A cradle is attached to the reverse, including the new strips of wood. The entire reverse was coated with a wax-resin substance which has a cloudy and distinctly amber appearance. \n\nThe paint layers of this picture are generally abraded and/or thinned. The background appears to be heavily restored. A distinctive restorer's aging technique of rubbing dark water-soluble ink into the wide-aperature drying cracks of the painting has been used on this painting. These deposits of ink are best seen in the red background although the ink has also deposited into the mechanical cracks visible in the lighter passages of the painting. \n\nThe flesh tones of this portrait are very thinly painted, as is typical for Cranach, however strong cleaning at some time prior to the painting entering the Museum's collection has thinned the paint layers further. \n\nThe folds in the clothing have been executed in a fairly formulaic and not entirely convincing manner. However, the dark passages of this painting are somewhat obscured by the uneven and hazy varnish coating the picture.\n\nThis surface coating of this picture is brittle, with an overall small-scale crack pattern and a milky streakiness most readily apparent in the darks.\n\n[US_MMANY_08-19_FR424B_2008-04_ExaminationandConditionReport.pdf]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"17.04.2008","endDate":"17.04.2008"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"09.

The panel was very likely thinned and strips of wood approximately 3/8″ (1 cm) wide, with the grain running in the long direction of the strips and therefore perpendicular to the grain of the original panel, were attached to the top and bottom of the panel. \nThe use of beech as a support, while generally unusual for the time, is consistent with Cranach’s particular workshop practices in the 1520s and 30s. The dimensions of the panel are not significantly out of keeping with the sizes typical for Cranach at this time.[1]\n\n\n\n\n[1] Heydenreich 2007 A, 43\n\n[US_MMANY_08-19_FR424B_2008-04_ExaminationandConditionReport.pdf]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"This panel appears to have a very thin preparation, typical especially for Cranach’s later works when the workshop was highly productive.[1] This thin, reflective ground is visible in losses scattered throughout the painting, most easily visible in the numerous small losses in the black clothing.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Heydenreich 2007 A,  93\n\n[US_MMANY_08-19_FR424B_2008-04_ExaminationandConditionReport.pdf]"},{"keywords":[{"additional":"","name":"Infrared reflectography"}],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"Infrared reflectography (IRR) using an Indigo Merlin NIR video camera aided in distinguishing a few lines of underdrawing in this painting, some of which are also visible through the paint layers with high-powered magnification.

Of particular note is the manner in which the beard was created. A fairly large brush loaded with a fluid dark brown paint was used to block in the beard. Under IRR the sweeping brushstrokes are clearly visible. Once this layer was dry, small brushstrokes in black, brown and ochre tones were applied to create the individual directional and curling hairs of the facial hair. Broad brushstrokes can also be seen in the background to the left of the figure, rendered visible under IR illumination due to the dark pigment added to the red to create the figure’s cast shadow. The long brushstrokes come up to the edge of the figure, following the contours of the shoulder, neck, ear and hat.\n \nThe flesh tones of this portrait are very thinly painted, as is typical for Cranach, however strong cleaning in the past has thinned the paint layers further. The flesh appears to have been worked up from the shadows, using a mixture of chunky dark pigments to create the form of the face, neck and hands, followed by thin scumbles of lighter paints containing lead white (est.) and red pigments, working up to the more opaque highlights. The eyes present an interesting detail: from the center of each eye, a clean brush was pulled horizontally through the wet paint, in the direction of the sitter’s gaze.\n \nThe jewelry is also painted in a somewhat schematic manner typical for Cranach and his workshop. A combination of brown, ochre and light yellow (lead-tin yellow pigment, based on appearance and x-radiography) paints have been applied in layers to serve as the dark, middle and light tones, respectively. The brown and warm ochre portions appear to have been worked wet-on-wet while the full-bodied, crisp pale yellow highlights seem to have been added after the other colors had dried. The signet ring on the Duke’s proper right forefinger has been enhanced with a large blue stone painted with a chunky light greenish-blue pigment set with white highlights.\n \nThe folds in the clothing have been executed in a fairly formulaic and not entirely convincing manner. \n\nA small cleaning test in the upper left corner revealed fragments of what appears to be a red lake paint. It is difficult to come to any firm conclusions based on such fragmentary and peripheral evidence, however it is possible that an upper layer of red lake glaze originally existed on this painting and the more orange-hued red now visible was intended to be an underlayer.\n\n[US_MMANY_08-19_FR424B_2008-04_ExaminationandConditionReport.pdf]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Silvia Centeno","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"17.04.2008","endDate":"17.04.2008"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"10.
