The red robe wafting gently in the breeze probably refers to the Passion, whereas the banner on the glass rod is a trophy testifying to the triumphant victory over death. Behind him the city of Jerusalem is visible, while the surprised watchmen sleeping around the sarcophagus begin to rouse from their slumber. The donor family (possibly that of Michael Teubers [1]) is represented as a detached group in the foreground. \n[1] see also discussion/comments","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 187.5 x 136.5 cm\n[Exhib.
