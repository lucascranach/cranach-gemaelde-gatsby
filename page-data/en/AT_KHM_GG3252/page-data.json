{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-real-object-page-jsx","path":"/en/AT_KHM_GG3252","result":{"pageContext":{"additionalTextInformation":[{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Elector August of Saxony was the second born son of the saxon Duke Heinrich (1473-1541). At the age of 16 August spent considerable time at the court of Emperor Ferdinand I. where he began a life-long friendship with the heir to the throne Maximilian and with Archduke Ferdinand of Tirol. In 1548 he married Anna, the daughter of King Christian III of Denmark. After the death of Elector Moritz, his elder brother, in the year 1553 he became his successor [Rößler 1953, Bd. I, 448-450]. \n \nThe full-length portrait of August of Saxony and his wife, Duchess Anna were conceived as a pendant pair. According to the convention of the time the wife of the elector is positioned on the heraldic left side. The common architectural background relates the sitters to each other, whereas their gaze is directed towards the viewer. The sumptuous decoration of the clothing worn by the electoral pair is striking, as well as the representation of the accessories set with precious stones and the rich jewellery. The black clothing indicates the influence of contemporary Spanish court fashion [Moraht-Fromm 2011, 275]; for ‘the time of Spanish fashion’ see [Bönsch 2011,129-130, 142].\nDespite the precise execution and the exact reproduction of the details of the cloth this double portrait is only a second version after the signed portraits from 1564 and 1565 by Lucas Cranach the Younger (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden; see [Schütz 1972, Nos. 30 und 31]). Another version of the pair is preserved in Freiberg (Stadt und Bergbaumuseum). The three versions differ in decorative details and the richness of the represented embroidery. Jutta von Bloh relates this to the purpose of the paintings, suggesing that the Ambras double portrait was a gift to the imperial house and may also show one of the pageant rapiers given by the Hapsburgs [Bloh 2005, 174–181, 180-181]. In this context it is worth mentioning that Elector August received a richly decorated rapier (dagger) from Emperor Maximilian II in April 1575 on the occasion of his visit to Dresden [Keller 2010, 68]. Whereas the gift of the Freiberg portraits of the Electoral pair to the city council in 1572 is documented, this can only be assumed of the Ambras double portrait. Therefore the date cannot be given any more precisely than 'after 1565'. Both the Ambras and the Freiberg paintings are executed on canvas. This support was favoured for paintings, which were to be sent [Kolb 2005, 520-521]. The personal relationship with Emperor Maximilian II. supports the theory that the double portrait went directly from the workshop of Cranach the Younger to the imperial collection [Ketelsen, Exhib. Cat. Innsbruck 2012, Nos. 1.3, 1.4]. \n\n[Alice Hoppe-Harnoncourt, Kunsthistorisches Museum 2012] [Translation, Smith, cda]","year":2012}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1565,"dated":"after 1565","end":1585,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1559","end":"1569","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Exhib.

The stretcher is not original. \nHere, as with the female pendant (AT_KHM_GG3141_FR-none), the original format of the painting was trimmed marginally: the canvas was folded over on all four sides. The paint continues over the tacking edge, generally in the monochrome, light paint of the architectural background, and partially with the paint from the foreground. There are black-painted lines analogous with the pendant along the tacking margin, which is in part only fragmentarily preserved.  It may be assumed that the tacking margin was originally integrated into the painted surface and that the canvas was stretched flat on a strainer. Simple battens were attached to the edge to create a frame. The black-painted lines may be seen within the context of the very common contemporary stretching and framing system. [see Heydenreich 2007 B, 251-252].\nThe extent to which the format has been altered can be approximately reconstructed on the basis of the evidence at the edge of the painting and the slight trace of cusping. The right side was folded over most, the paint from the foreground (marble floor) continues over the tacking margin and has been trimmed flush with the stretcher, a black-painted boarder is only present in the upper section.\nOn the left edge there is a c. 2 cm wide line, which corresponds with the right edge of the female pendant, the alteration is presumably marginal here. The tacking margins along the top and bottom edges are quite fragmented, although it may be assumed that more was folded over at the top than at the bottom."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- white ground; analysis was not carried out"},{"keywords":[{"additional":"","name":"Infrared reflectography"}],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"In contrast with the female pendant (AT_KHM_GG3141_FR_none) considerably less underdrawing is visible here. In the face lines can only be discerned in the area of the eyebrows and on the ear. However on the left in the background there is - mirror-inverted to the pendant - a vanishing line, which runs at the same angle. In the foreground (tiles) construction lines can be observed, that run parallel to the painted version, but have generally been displaced slightly. The underdrawing appears to be with a dry drawing material. \nIn addition to the underdrawing numerous pentimenti are revealed by the infrared reflectogram in the area of the sitter: the contours of the collar and the overcoat on the left side were originally slightly further to the left.  The lower contour of his robe was also corrected - the overcoat and the trousers originally ended somewhat further down, his right thigh was slightly wider. This pentiment is also visible to the naked eye."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The manner of painting is the same as that of the female pendant (AT_KHM_GG3141_FR-none).\nThe paint application was generally opaque and in places with very bold brushstrokes, particularly in the rapidly executed sections of the architecture in the background. The figure on the other hand is worked up with great attention to detail, above all in the elaborate embroidery and the appliquéd decorative elements on his clothes; highlights exhibit a slight impasto paint application. The coloured shadows on the marble tiles in the foreground were achieved with thin glazes. Light areas like the flesh paint received an initial local application of paint. The generously applied underpainting of the face is clearly visible in the x-radiograph. The sequence of paint application is as follows: presumably the flesh paint was laid in first, followed by the black sections of the draperies (with the exception of the hat) and the marble floor in the foreground. Then the architectural background was painted, first the green, followed by the lighter sections and the cool, blue-grey of the perspective through the arch. The paint application of the fore- and background overlaps the figure; here a pentiment is also visible: the right contour of the collar and overcoat were originally further to the left. A minor correction was also made to the lower contour of his clothes - his overcoat and trousers were originally somewhat longer, his right thigh was slightly wider. This area, that had already been painted, was covered by the background paint as is shown by the bold brushstrokes clearly visible in the infrared (see fig. AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none_2012-03-26_IRR).  \nWhite areas like the neck-ruff or the jewellery and decorative elements of his clothing were executed last. The same goes for the headdress, which was left in reserve; the hat was then painted slightly beyond the reserve."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- not original\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SA-KsDW_M04-2003","remark":"","text":"Gehört thematisch zu"}],"signature":"None","sortingNumber":"1566-001","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"214.50","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"August, Elector of Saxony (1526-1586)","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":412},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none_2012-03-30_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":823},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none_2012-03-30_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1235},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none_2012-03-30_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3479,"height":7160},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none_2012-03-30_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG3252_FR-none_2012-03-30_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
