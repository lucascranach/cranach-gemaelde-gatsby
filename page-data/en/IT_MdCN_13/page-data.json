His left hand holds the wrist of the adulterous woman, his right points two fingers at her. She wears an orange dress, the bodice of which is slightly torn open revealing her breast. Her eyes are cast downward. Gathered around Christ are men each with distinct features as well a different facial expressions. Some of the apostles are also included. To Christ's right is a white bearded man, who seems to be in discussion with him. The men have already prepared themselves for the stoning. One man in the foreground has a bag of rocks and is poised to act, clutching a stone in his right hand. The scene is brought closer to the viewer by the chosen composition, which takes place against a dark background. There is an inscription at the upper edge.\n[cda 2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 56 x 77 cm\n[https://www.photo.rmn.fr/archive/07-502861-2C6NU0PS92SA.html]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4673,"height":3414}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":146},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G/01_Overall/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G_2013_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":292},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G/01_Overall/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G_2013_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":438},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G/01_Overall/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G_2013_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4673,"height":3414},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G/01_Overall/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G_2013_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G/01_Overall/IT_MdCN_13_FR364G_2013_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- along the upper edge: 'WER VNDER EVCH ON SVNDE IST .
