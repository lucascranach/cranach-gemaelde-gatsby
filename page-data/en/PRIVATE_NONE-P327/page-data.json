Around his head is a radiating nimbus-like halo. It appears to be the missing companion to a panel depicting Saint John the Baptist [PRIVATE_NONE-P010]. The two paintings were presumably originally opposing wings of an altarpiece. The compositions of the Evangelist would appear to be taken from a print by Cranach, but here in reverse.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 77.2 x 29.2 cm\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/workshop-of-lucas-cranach-i-saint-john-4266301-details.aspx?;
