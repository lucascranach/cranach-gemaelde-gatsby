This was a very common way for European artists during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to depict famous stories from religion and ancient myths. Two important episodes from the story of Jesus' life are painted here -we see him praying in the Garden of Gethsemane on the night he was arrested, and the moment he was captured. These scenes were written about in the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. \nIn the upper left corner of this painting a figure with outstretched arms represents Christ praying as a messenger angel appears with a cross, foretelling Christ's Crucifixion. Behind him, three of Jesus's disciples (Peter, James, and John)\nsleep serenely, unaware of the importance of the night. \nThe center of this painting represents a later moment during the same night, when Judas greeted Jesus with a kiss on the cheek. This was the signal Judas agreed to make so the soldiers with him knew who to arrest. \n[Norton Museum of Art]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 75.88 x 54.9 cm (29 7/8 x 21 5/8 in)\n[Norton Museum of Art, revised 2018]\n76 x 56 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 1979]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1747,"height":2436}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":279},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":558},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":837},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1747,"height":2436},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":279},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":558},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":837},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1747,"height":2436},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":5284,"height":3472}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":131},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/04_X-radiograph/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_X-radiograph_Detail-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":263},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/04_X-radiograph/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_X-radiograph_Detail-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":394},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/04_X-radiograph/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_X-radiograph_Detail-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":5284,"height":3472},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/04_X-radiograph/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_X-radiograph_Detail-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/04_X-radiograph/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_X-radiograph_Detail-001.dzi"}}]}},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_NMA_57-22","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > states > Florida > counties > Palm Beach > inhabited places > West Palm Beach","term":"West Palm Beach","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > states > Florida > counties > Palm Beach > inhabited places > West Palm Beach","term":"West Palm Beach","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 1979]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 75.88 x 54.9 cm (29 7/8 x 21 5/8 in)\n[Norton Museum of Art, revised 2018]\n76 x 56 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 1979]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1515","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"US_NMA_57-22","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NMA_57-22_FR075/01_Overall/US_NMA_57-22_FR075_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Betrayal and Capture of Christ"},"objectId":930174,"objectName":"FR075","owner":"Norton Museum of Art, Florida","provenance":"- 1905 in the collection of R.
