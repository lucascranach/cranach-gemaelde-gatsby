In 1496 she married George, Duke of Saxony (1471-1539), whose portrait was also painted by Cranach. Both appear as donors on two panels from an altarpiece in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection (see FR 1978, no. 28, p. 74), probably dating from around 1508-10. The portrait of the Duchess in this work formed the basis of later depictions including the present work, which was executed by the workshop most probably after her death.'\n[Christie's Online database;
