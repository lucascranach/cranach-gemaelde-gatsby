She wears a dress, the bodice of which is slightly torn open revealing her breast. Her hair is tied back with a thin black band. Her eyes are cast downward. To Christ's right are three bearded men, they seem to be in discussion with him. The one in the foreground has a bag of rocks and is clutching a stone behind his back in his right hand. More men throng behind and look on from Christ’s left.
