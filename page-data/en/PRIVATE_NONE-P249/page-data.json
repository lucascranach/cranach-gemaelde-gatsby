Almost all of them are of this type: Erasmus is half-length, facing to our left, hands clasped at his waist. The majority, too, are on a small scale such as this. Cranach's composition is derived from Hans Holbein's famous depiction of the sitter, executed in 1523, now in a private collection.\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/old-master-british-paintings-day-sale-l15037/lot.152.html?locale=en;
