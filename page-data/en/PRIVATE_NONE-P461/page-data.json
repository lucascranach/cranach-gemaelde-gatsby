Moreover it also suggests that if the overpaint detected around the signature and the date is taken into consideration it is possible that the date on this painting may also have originally read ‘1525 rather than '1528'. The entry also lists a further 4 versions, including two with text, one in a private collection [PRIVATE_NONE-P244], the other in Huis Bergh, Holland [NL_SSHBH_43]. The remaining two are without text, one in the Barnes Foundation, USA [US_BFP_BF867] and the other formerly in Blankenburg Castle in the Harz.\n[See online database Koller Auktionen, accessed 01.10.2020](https://www.kollerauktionen.ch/de/335153-0214-1188-LUCAS-CRANACH-D.-Ae.-UND-WERKST-1188_462197.html?RecPos=3)","year":2020}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1525,"dated":"1528","end":1528,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1520","end":"1530","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"'during a previous restauration campaign the figure '5' was changed to an '8'' [Online database Koller Auktionen, accessed 01.10.2020](https://www.kollerauktionen.ch/de/335153-0214-1188-LUCAS-CRANACH-D.-Ae.-UND-WERKST-1188_462197.html?RecPos=3)","text":"1525"}],"remarks":"[dated, the figure '5' may have been changed to an '8' during a previous restoration campaign]"},"description":"A bust-length portrait of Friedrich the Wise in three quarter profile against a neutral background, facing to his left.
