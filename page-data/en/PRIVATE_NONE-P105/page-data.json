The scene showing the newborn child in the crib, the Virgin praying and Joseph with a candle has been rendered full of atmosphere. A crowd of adoring angels, who in their nakedness are only distinguishable from Jesus by their wings, encircle the austere stone trough. Calm and attentive the Virgin looks at her child, while Joseph holds his right hand protectively in front of the candle as if blinded. The intimate setting on the stone floor with the ox and ass is framed by the old walls. Three shepherds peer over one of the walls and point at the newborn. The annunciation to the shepherds is only referred to incidentally in the background.\n\n[Annette Hörig, in Exhib. Cat. Aachen 2015, No. 53]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 58 x 81 cm\n[Exhib.
