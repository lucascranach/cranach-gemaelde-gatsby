During the most recent treatment wooden battens, that had been glued to the reverse in a previous treatment were replaced by strips of plexiglas, losses in the wood were partially filled with a wooden fill material, smoothed with a glue/chalk mixture and retouched. The frame offers the panel sufficient stability. \nDespite this the panel is in danger of suffering new damage to the support and paint surface caused by dimensional changes as it responds to fluctuating temperature and relative humidity. This potential damage is already visible as a new loss in the robe of St Blase, on the left above his hand.

The underdrawing serves as such its original function as a guide for the painted version. This linear drawing is similar to that on the St Catharine Altarpiece in Dresden (1506, Galerie Alte Meister Dresden) and can be placed within the context of an identified transitional phase. However, one specific feature, which has not been observed on other underdrawings by Cranach is the use of washes to create areas of light. It also seems that the initial design was reworked. Detailed inspection shows that this was particularly the case at the centre of the image in the head of St Christopher and the neighbouring heads.

If this is the same person as the Meister Michel Tischer who, among other things, produced doors, windows, shutters and panelling at Schloss Hartenfels between 1514 and 1517 (app. II, 63),4 then we have here some explanation as to why he always glued the planks of the early panels with the grain oriented parallel to the shorter dimension of the panel.

The white imprimatura on top of the drawing smoothes out washes, some strokes of hatching, and the outlines, resulting in a grisaille -like undermodelling.'\n \n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 107-108]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"'On the Fourteen Helpers in Need , Cranach underpainted the cloak of St Christopher with red iron oxide , red lead and vermilion (fig. 84), and the folds are defined with red iron oxide, vermilion and black paint. Shadows are deepened in black and illuminated edges are indicated with vermilion. Finally, luminosity was heightened by a red glaze applied over\n\nlarge passages (D, fig. 134). In contrast the robes of St Panthaleon, the infant Christ and the angel on the verso are given shape with lead white mixed with red lake pigments (B, figs 95, 187). The underlying paint is an opaque pink, layered over with semi-transparent shades and, fi nally, translucent red glazes . A higher content of white emphasises the folds and rich red glazes accentuate the shadows. Here the specific red lake pigment used for fi nal glazing differs from that used in the underpainting (see p. 139). St Erasmus' mitre and St Dionysius' robe are again worked up in a different technique (figs 34, 95).\n\nHere the painter achieved the velvety effect simply with red glazes over black washes of the underdrawing (A). On the reverse of the same panel, the inner lining of the robe of the angel on the left, painted with red iron oxide and lead tin yellow in yellow-red tone, demonstrates Cranach's extensive repertoire (P).'\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 185]\n\n \n\n'Because of the high calcium content in the black background paint of the Fourteen Helpers in Need , Neelmeijer, Wagner and Schramm concluded that ivory black had been used.260 However, EDX examination of cross-sections showed that, although the black paint contains traces of white calcium salt, there is no phosphorus to indicate the presence of bone black or ivory black. There are various reasons why calcium carbonate would be present as a component of paint containing soot: it could be a residue from combustion, vestiges of calcium from the preparation process,261 or a mixture with an organic lake pigment containing chalk as an extender or substrate.262 It is also conceivable that chalk was added to the soot black , which is of small particle size, in order to improve its handling properties and/or to reduce the amount of binding medium. The addition of chalk would also improve the drying properties (see p. 133).'\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 163]\n\n \n\n'On various works such as the Crucifixion (1503), the panel with the Fourteen Helpers in Need (c.1505/07) and the Altarpiece of the Holy Kinship (1509), hands are used to finely disperse glazes.'\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 193]\n\n \n\n'On the panel with the Fourteen Helpers in Need (c.1505/07), the washes with a black drawing medium that model shadows create a close link between the underdrawing and the painting process (figs 90, 91). Black ink, the white imprimatura and thin, slightly translucent fl esh tones were used to create grey half shadows. No similar modelling has been observed on any other of the works examined. On this panel the light modelling was achieved either by a stippling application of paint or with softly flowing strokes of the brush without necessarily being related to the anatomical form. The paint was subtly worked up into bright pink fl esh tints or shaded to pale tones, in the latter case using azurite . On the X-radiographs it becomes particularly evident that the smooth shapes of womens' faces were highlighted by stippling the paint with a blunt bristle brush. The intended effect was achieved with a few brown and pink glazes either spread on or hatched. Last, reflections of light, very deep shadow folds and contour lines were emphasised with a pointed brush.\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 199-200]\n\n \n\n'As already pointed out, the first layer of the fl esh was carried out in a very early stage; but the final graduation of tonal values was one of the last measures in the entire painting process (fig. 174).102 To illustrate this point, the panel with the Fourteen Helpers in Need (c.1505/07) has pink-coloured highlights that have been applied on previously painted drapery in the areas of the necks of St Cyprian and St Giles (fig. 177), while flesh tints on St Giles at the end have again been trimmed by the borderline of the paint modeling the black robe.'\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 210]\n\n \n\nGilding\n\n'The gold on several panels such as the Portrait of the Wife of a Viennese Scholar (1503), the Fourteen Helpers in Need (c.1505/07) and the Holy Trinity (c.1515) was beaten to a thickness of approximately 500 nanometres (that is 0.0005\n\nmillimetres).'\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 116]\n\n \n\n'On the Fourteen Helpers in Need (1505/07), the adhesive is a drying oil containing lead white, lead-tin yellow, chalk, ochre, copper green and vermilion .'\n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 119-20]\n\n \n\n'The practices varied in the case of matt gilding . On the panel depicting the Fourteen Helpers in Need (c.1505/07,ifig. 34), the areas that were to be mordant gilded were outlined with a stylus before the white imprimatura was applied. Several details of drapery are also marked under the gold (fig. 94). However, when applying red-brown glazes on the gilding to model the shadows, Cranach largely ignored the incisions. It was not even necessary to mark the outline for this gilding technique, since the mordant could be applied exactly to the designated areas and thus adhesion could be restricted to these surfaces.\n\nThus, the spandrels on the verso of the panel with the Fourteen Helpers in Need are no longer delineated with incisions.' \n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 112]\n\n \n\n'On the Fourteen Helpers in Need (c.1505/07), he gave spatial effect to the metal leaf by extensive red-brown glazing (figs 34, 187).'\n\n \n\n[Heydenreich 2007 A, 120]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Gunnar Heydenreich","role":"written by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2011","endDate":"2011"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"16.
