They were distributed in books for the education of princes (>>Fürstenspiegel<<) as well as being used to decorate representative rooms in castles and town halls. Associated with the depiction of these narratives was the idea that the virtues and vices of illustrious figures could provide standards and role models for political action. The exempla of virtue could on the one hand have a moralizing-didactic character by illustrating correct behavior to the princes or councillors; they could also serve the legitimization of political power and interests by justifying the ruler’s virtuous behavior. The panels in Berlin illustrate the monarchical virtues of moderation, wisdom, justice and courage. […]\n\nIt may be assumed, that the complex content and composition of the four paintings were based on a design by the father. These were then executed rapidly – probably under the supervision of Lucas Cranach the Younger - by workshop members. This would explain slight inconsistencies in the proportions and other formal details. Friedländer, Rosenberg and Schade on the other hand suggest that the painting is an autographed work by the son.‘\n\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat. Berlin 2009, 200-201, nos.

[…] A pen and ink drawing in Leipzig (Cat. No. III. 24) probably served as a preparatory drawing for this painting. In the painting the modestly dressed Bathsheba hardly has the appearance of a seductress and the adultery seems to have been initiated by the king. As such the painting is less a warning against female lust and more a reminder of the sin of adultery and in association with that a plea for moderation.’\n\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.

Samuel, II). He falls in love with Bathsheba, the wife of his general Uria. She first becomes his lover and then after he had sent her husband to his death she became his second wife.  \nIn the painting Bathsheba is depicted sitting on the banks of a river. She wears a contemporary dark red robe and numerous pieces of jewellery in accordance with court attire of the time. One of her entourage washes her feet. Four more elegantly dressed ladies are gathered around her. However, she only pays attention to King David who stands in the tower and plays the harp. \n[see Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.
