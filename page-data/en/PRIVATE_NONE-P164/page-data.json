Twelve years later, on the 18th of April 1567, Christian Brück was executed in the market square in Gotha. He was involved in a dispute over landownership between Wilhelm von Grumbach, Emperor Maximillian II and Elector August of Saxony, the so-called Grumbach Feud, which resulted in the lifelong imprisonment of the duke and the execution of all others involved. \nLucas Cranach the Younger presents himself with this work as an outstanding portraitist, who two years after the death of his father very successfully continued the running of his workshop. The portrait study of the chancellor no longer survives, but the design was evidently transferred to the prepared panel employing red chalk and then combined with hands from the workshop’s stock of templates. Worth mentioning in this context is that the position of the hands appears to be almost identical to that found on a portrait of Elector Johann Friedrich I by Titian from 1550. Cranach the Younger evidently knew this painting by the Italian master and adapted the pictorial element and gave it a new context with the pearl chain. […]\nThe authentic inscription identifies the sitter as a 37 year old in 1555 and thus it can be concluded that contrary to previous belief Christian Brück was not born until 1518. \n[Heydenreich, Exhib.
