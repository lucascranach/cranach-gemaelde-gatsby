Christ is shown sitting on the left edge of Jacob’s well, which is positioned at the centre of the composition. He is in conversation with the Samaritan woman who draws water from the well with a bucket. In the background the town of Sycar is represented by contemporary German architecture. A group of people enter along a steep path from the right, possibly the disciples lead by St Peter and accompanied by some of the citizens of Sycar. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50 x 34 cm\n[handwritten note on the reverse of a photograph; Koepplin Archive]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2966,"height":4325}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":595},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":893},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2789,"height":4150},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":292},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":583},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":875},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2966,"height":4325},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P390_FR-none_c1990_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P390","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Hans Cranach","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Hans Cranach","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"?
