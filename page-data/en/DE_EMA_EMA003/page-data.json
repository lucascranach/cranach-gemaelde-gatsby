God the Father presents the viewer with a frontal view of his son as the Man of Sorrows. The dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit hovers with outspread wings beneath. Christ holds rods and a whip as a sign of the Passion, further tools of martyrdom are held by the angels arranged either side of God the Father. Set in an expansive landscape the donor family kneels at the edge of the pictorial space beneath the crucified Christ. The mayor of Annaberg, Johan Schwaz, is shown on the left side with rosary beads, his offsprings kneel behind him, and are considerably smaller in scale. The right side is occupied by the female members of the family, consisting of three adult women, two girls and a child who died in infancy. Either side of the cross both families' coats-of-arms are displayed directly in front of the donors. According to the inscription the church Father Augustine is represented in the middle-ground. This figure as well as the beggar kneeling in front of him have not been successfully intergrated into the pictorial space. The infrared reflectogram shows that they were repeatedly reworked.\n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of painted surface: 165 x 141.7 cm\n[Heydenreich, cda
