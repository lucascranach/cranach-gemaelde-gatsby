The lettering and content of the biblical quotation from Mark 10, 14 diverge slightly on all three paintings. Furthermore, this variant and the one in Mainz both exhibit the griffin head cypher associated with the monogrammist HB, whereas the lost painting was signed with the Cranach insignia of the winged serpent and the monogram 'HB'.\n\n[cda 2021]","year":2021}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1545,"dated":"about 1550","end":1555,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Brunk Auctions, Asheville, North Carolina, revised 2019]"},"description":"Christ is depicted in the centre crowded by both infants and young women dressed in fine Renaissance clothes and jewellery and likely representing patrons. A woman at the left still has her hand under her child as Christ cradles him in His arms. A male head to left represents one of the disciples whose desire to shield Christ has been over-ruled verbally and cleverly included as a device within the composition.
