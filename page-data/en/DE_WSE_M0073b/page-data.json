Since Johann Friedrich's accession to office in 1532 this form of triple portrait was commissioned in large numbers to underline the dynastic legitimation of his political claim to power  with reference to his predecessors. This appeared more necessary than ever as the dispute with the emperor intensified. After the death of his father Charles V. refused to endow  Johann Friedrich with the electoral dignity, nor would he acknowledge his Jülich marriage contract. [1]  Johann Friedrich was counting on the effectiveness of the portraits to acheive good publicity for the legitimacy of his claims. At the same time the crown in Friedrich the Wise's hand may recall that initially after the death of Emperor Maximilian I. in 1519 the electorals were strong candidates in the imperial election. Furthermore the fact that the elector was general governor and one of the two imperial vicars and as such occupied a prominent position as administrator to the emperor may have been expressed by this attribute. \nThe prototype for the triptych in the Wartburg (1566) is probably the triple portrait in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, created after 1532. The central panel depicting Friedrich the Wise, which was cropped at some stage in the past, probably also originally showed him holding the imperial crown in his right hand. [2] \nThe artist of the Eisenach Triptych, Johann Lange from Gotha (monogram 'ILG'), was employed since 1563 as court painter for Duke Johann Friedrich the Middle, the son of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous. In 1566/67 he had unsuccessfully attempted to win back the electoral dignity lost by his father. Against this background Cranach's  portrait of the last three electors acquired a current relevance for the dynasty, which may have lead to this copy by Lange. \nIn contrast to the prototype now in Nuremberg Johann Lange added a vase with a veronica behind the figure of Friedrich the Wise. In the 16th century it was believed that this plant warded off harm, offered solace and in addition it stood for humility (German Ehrenpreis (Ehr and Preis): honour and reward), which was also associated with Christ's passion.[3]\n[1] Schade 1974, 54\n[2] Koepplin 2007, 306 f.\n[3] Schulze 2004, 113 \n\n[Exhib.
