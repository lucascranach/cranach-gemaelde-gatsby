Cranach portrayed the nymph as a seductive German woman resting on her bundled gown. Her nudity is emphasized by her jewels and filmy veils. A Latin inscription warns, \"I am the nymph of the sacred spring. Do not disturb my sleep. I am resting.\" Coyly, however, this nymph peers through half-open eyes. Her bow and quiver of arrows are attributes of Diana, the mythological goddess of the hunt, who also symbolizes chastity. The game birds could refer to Diana or to Venus, the goddess of erotic love. Thus the subject is tantalizingly ambiguous.\nFor his courtly patrons, Cranach provided several versions of this provocative theme. On the rock above the spring is the artist's device, a winged serpent. In 1508 the Saxon duke ennobled Cranach, who thereafter often signed his paintings with a flying-serpent motif.\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43716&detail=note] (accessed 08.02.2013)","year":null},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"'There are more than sixteen painted depictions of this subject [The Nymph of the Spring] and a drawing (formerly Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden by Cranach and his shop [1]. Because of variations in the details of the setting and the pose of the nymph, no two works are exactly the same. The precise source for the pose of Cranach's nymph is not known, although several authors have called attention to the similarities to Giorgione's 'Venus' (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Gemäldegalerie, Dresden) or suggested that Giorgione might have painted a version, now lost, of the Nymph of the Spring [2]. Furthermore, Cranach might have been influenced by the woodcut depiction of a sleeping fountain nymph and satyr in Francesco Colonna's 'Hypnerotomachia Polophili', or Italian prints such as Girolamo Mocetto's engraving of 'Amymone', c. 1500/1514, or the drawing attributed to Dürer of 'The Nymph of the Spring', c. 1514. It is possible that Cranach might have known an antique source for the reclining figure, perhaps through a drawing or a print [3].\nThe earliest versions of the theme, the paintings in the Staatliche Schlösser uund Gärten, Jagdschloss Grunewald, Berlin, dated c. 1515/1516, and the Museum der bildenden Künste, Leipzig, dated 1518, simply show the nymph lying in front of the fountain [4]. The drawing formerly in Dresden, usually dated c. 1525, is probably the first image to include what might be called the secondary attributes – the bow, arrows in a quiver, and partridges – that are found in the National Gallery's panel [5]. Somewhat later than the drawing are the paintings containing these objects in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, Lugano, dated between c. 1526/1530 and c. 1530/1535, and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, dated 1534 [6].\nBecause of the folded wings of the serpent in the artist's device, the Washington version of 'The Nymph of the Spring' is dated after 1537. Koepplin and Falk find stylistic similarities with the version in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besancon, which they date c. 1540/1550 [7]. Comparison can also be made to the version in the Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo, dated 1550 [8].\nEven though late in date, the National Gallery's painting is to be grouped with the works of Lucas Cranach the Elder and is different in style and execution from those versions in Kassel and New York that are likely to be by Lucas the Younger [9].\n \n[1] DE_SPSG_GKI1926_FR119A; DE_MdbKL_757_FR119; ES_MTB_115-1986-13_FR120; FR120A; FR259; FR232C; FR402; FR402A; FR403A; FR403B; FR403C; FR404; DE_BRD-KHB_935-1966-7_FR-none; formerly Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden, pen and brown ink and grey wash, 116 x 206 mm, [Rosenberg 1960, 22.

This view was accepted by several subsequent authors, among them [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, 49, No. 100], [Kurz 1953, 176], however, suggested that the prototype might have been a lost painting by Giorgione depicting Venus resting after the hunt with a herd of deer in the background. [Bonicatti, Cieri 1974, Fig. 15], reproduce a Giorgionesque drawing of a nymph and faun with a deer in the background. And as noted by Kurz, deer appear in the background of Cranach's drawing in Dresden.\n[3] [Liebmann 1968, 435-437], emphasizes the importance of the 'Hypnerotomachia Poliphili', published in Venice in 1499.

Cranach's painting of a classical nymph represents an Italian theme but gives it a moralizing twist common to late Gothic courtly and amorous subjects.\nThe nymph reclines beside a spring, perhaps a reference to a legendary ancient Roman fountain with which a Latin verse was associated. The text was translated by Alexander Pope in 1725: \n\n'Nymph of the grot, these springs I keep, \nAnd to the murmurs of these waters sleep; \nAh, spare my slumbers, gently tread the cave! \nAnd drink in silence, or in silence lave!'\n\nThe inscription on this painting -- I am the nymph of the sacred spring, do not disturb my sleep. I am resting -- may be an allusion to the poem. Though exposed by modern scholarship as a fifteenth-century counterfeit, the poem influenced Italian garden decoration, which not infrequently included fountains with attendant reclining nymphs. However, the proportions of Cranach's nude are more Gothic than classical, and the robe on which she rests her head is that of a German court lady. Far from sleeping, she admires herself beguilingly through lowered eyelids. The painting is intended both as an enticement and a warning to Cranach's sophisticated patrons.\n\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43716] (accessed 08.02.2013)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 48.4 x 72.8 cm (19 1/16 x 28 11/16 in.) \nDimensions including frame: 62.9 x 87.6 cm (24 3/4 x 34 1/2 in.)\n\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=43716] (accessed 08.02.2013)","exhibitionHistory":"1939 New York, No. 5A\n1939 New York, No. 59\n1940 San Francisco, No. 137 \n1998 Madrid, No. 253\n2003 - 2004 Stockholm, No. 2","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3000,"height":1952}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":130},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403/01_Overall/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":260},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403/01_Overall/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":390},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403/01_Overall/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3000,"height":1952},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403/01_Overall/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403/01_Overall/US_NGA_1957-12-1_FR403_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- top left: \n'FONTIS NYMPHA SACRI SOM: / NVM NE RVMPE QVIESCO'\n(I am the Nymph of the Sacred Spring.
