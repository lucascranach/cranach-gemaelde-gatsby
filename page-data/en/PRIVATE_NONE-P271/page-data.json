St John supports his torso at the right edge of the image.  Mary Magdalene kneels in the centre, wearing a red robe and kissing Christ's left hand.

Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus are shown at the right hand side, one holding the crown of thorns, while the other grasps the white cloth wrapped around Christ's legs.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 42 x 78 cm\n[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/856-1/1033-lucas-cranach-d-ae.html; accessed 26-03-2019]","exhibitionHistory":"Cologne 1935","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3784,"height":2520}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":133},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none_2004_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":266},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none_2004_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":400},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none_2004_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3784,"height":2520},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none_2004_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none_2004_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P271","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/856-1/1033-lucas-cranach-d-ae.html; accessed 26-03-2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/856-1/1033-lucas-cranach-d-ae.html; accessed 26-03-2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 42 x 78 cm\n[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/856-1/1033-lucas-cranach-d-ae.html; accessed 26-03-2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"after 1537","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P271","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P271_FR-none_2004_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Lamentation"},"objectId":951921,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- private collection, Switzerland \n- private collection, Rhineland \n- 22.05.2004 auctioned at Lempertz, Cologne, auction 856, lot 1033\n[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/856-1/1033-lucas-cranach-d-ae.html; accessed 26-03-2019]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Dieter Koepplin","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"The painting is in good condition (with the exception of minimal retouching along the horizontal joints). \n[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/856-1/1033-lucas-cranach-d-ae.html; accessed 26-03-2019]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"1989","endDate":""},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"02.
