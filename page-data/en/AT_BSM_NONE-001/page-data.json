After the fire of 1738 it was redecorated and a new vaulting was installed. The ceremonial hall was completed with a paintings gallery under Abbott Urban II. Hauer (1763-1785). 146 small format paintings on various supports were grouped to create five boards that were mounted on the walls. The individual images are for the greater part copies after 17th and 18th works. The central panel on the end wall displays a depiction of ‘The Virgin in a Bower’, a painting attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder.","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1520,"dated":"about 1525","end":1530,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 162B]"},"description":"The Virgin is seated on a bench and occupies the central axis. She inclines her head slightly to the left and looks at the viewer, while the infant Christ stands on a brocade cushion on her lap. She supports him and he puts his arms around her neck. The Virgin's reddish blonde hair cascades in long curls over her shoulders and down her back, leading the viewer's eye to the arrangement of the folds. This consists of a bluish-green undergarment and a red coat with a greenish-orange shimmering lining. Over the bench a trellis extends to a bower that is covered with vines and grapes. A broad mountainous landscape extends behind the Virgin. \n[Daniel Görres, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2138,"height":2745}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":270},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":539},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":809},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1715,"height":2312},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":270},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":539},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":809},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1715,"height":2312},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":257},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":514},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":770},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2138,"height":2745},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":257},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":514},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":770},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2138,"height":2745},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B/01_Overall/AT_BSM_NONE-001_FR162B_2015_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"AT_BSM_NONE-001","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Anonymous Master from the Cranach Workshop","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Anonymous Master from the Cranach Workshop","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 162B]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"Ein Zettel an der Rückseite nennt Lukas Cranach als Urheber (a label on the reverse attributes it to Lucas Cranach [...]\n[Schier 1928, 98]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":6,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"Wahrscheinlich ist es eine Wiederholung einer vlämischen Arbeit in der Richtung des Mabuse.
