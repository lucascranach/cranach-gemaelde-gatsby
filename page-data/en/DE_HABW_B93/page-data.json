However due to the rather stiff execution of the Wolfenbüttel painting the attribution to a copyist after Lucas Cranach was not changed. Furthermore the portrait appears to have the same provenance as a portrait series of reformers created in the 17th century. It has also been observed that on surviving pendants from the Cranach workshop the signature is usually only on the Luther portrait. It is possible that the signature was added later after the painting was separated from its companion piece. \n[Cat.
