The wax has filled out lots of the holes from the wood worm attack.\nAll four edges of the panel are bevelled, since there is paint from the front on to the back in areas where the edges are thinner than 5 mm. \nThe lower plank has attacked some gauze on the back. The gauze does not cover the joint of the panel.\nThere are small residues of paint at the back of the panel, maybe from a mixture of white lead that were used to treat the wood worm attack.\nOn top of the joint of the two planks the wood is further planed to 3 mm. The joint is reinforced with eight mahogany pieces of wood (each 3 x 1.5 cm) which are glued across the joint to the back. Across these wooden pieces, eight other pieces of mahogany are glued on (each 5 x 1.5 cm).\nIt looks like there at some point were glued three wooden sticks to the back of the panel (each side and the bottom) in a lighter colour, since there are traces of this.\nThe ground and the translucent colour go right to the edge of the painting on the upper edge, which isn't the case of the three other sides of the painting. This indicates that the painting was originally higher than the current format.\n\nIn 2001 the frame was polished with microcrystalline wax.\n\n[Mette Kokkenborg, Statens Museum for Kunst, 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2013","endDate":"2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"02.
