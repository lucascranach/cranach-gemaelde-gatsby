The support must have been affected by woodworm before the planks were used as numerous exit holes on the painted side have been filled with a fill material -probably containing lead white (see Fig. AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-03-19_X-radiograph).\n- there is a dent of c. 10 cm in length and 1.4 cm in depth between planks IV and V. Here the remaining wood is only 0.5-0.6 cm thick. \n- The panel was trimmed along the bottom, and as a result wood fibres have broken off along the cut edge.  \n\nPaint Layers:\n\n- a curtain was also added later, mirror-invert to that on the male pendant. The coat-of-arms painted beneath in the upper left corner is clearly visible in the x-radiograph (see Beschreibung/Diskussion/Forschungsgeschichte ). It is not documented when this intervention occurred.\nThe coat-of-arms was overpainted in a frame, as the paint layer does not extend to the edge of the panel, but creates a barb c. 1 cm from the left edge (see Fig. AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-03-02_Photomicrograph-M6x-018). The paint layer of the curtain exhibits a strong x-ray absorption and presumably contains lead white or lead-tin-yellow. \n- the paint layers exhibit only a few, mostly very small losses; further isolated losses are located along the edges, particularly along the bottom edge. \n\n\n\n[Monika Strolz, Ute Tüchler, Kunsthistorisches Museum, revised 2012] \n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2012","endDate":"2012"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"01.

Plank II 15.7 (t.) 16.2 (b.) Plank III 10.6 (t.) 10.4 (b.) Plank IV 9.9 (t.) 10.7 (b.) Plank V 12.2 (t.) 11.8 (b.) Plank VI 7.8 (t.) 8.1 (b.) cm.\nThe reverse of the panel is original and from it we can deduce the construction of the panel, which occurred in two stages: first planks I and II as well as planks III to VI were glued together and prepared separately. This is evident when interpreting the concise block plane marks that run vertically on the left side of the panel and diagonally on the right side (see Fig. AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Overall_Reverse_Raking-Light). Only then were the two halves joined together to make the panel. One possible explanation for this method of construction could be that the planks were glued together and kept in reserve to use accordingly for the relevant panel. The join between the two parts of the panel was reinforced near the bottom edge with two counter hand-forged nails. The panel is 1.9-2.0 cm thick. The reverse of the panel exhibits a rebate, uneven in width (0.9 to 1.5 cm), on all sides, with the exception of the trimmed bottom edge. Where the rebate is present the panel is c. 0.7 cm thick. It has an anthracite coloured coating. \n- a strip the width of the rebate was probably trimmed off the bottom edge"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- white ground\n- an analysis was not carried out, probably glue bound calcium carbonate \n- the ground appplication extends to the edge of the panel, neither a barbe nor unpainted edges are present \n- different degrees of x-ray absorption indicates that the separately prepared panel pieces (see support) may also differ in terms of the number and/or composition of the ground layers.

The lower edge is trimmed making any assertion impossible. \nAs with the male pendant the flesh paint and other light areas like the sleeve and the apron were laid in first, before the red and black areas were applied. Finally the background was painted and at the same time the contour of the figure was defined. The numerous decorative elements like the necklace, the hairnet, the lace collar, decoration of the beret etc. were applied last and overlap the background in many places. \nThe manner of painting generally corresponds with that of the male pendant (AT_KHM_GG885_FR429), the coloring of the flesh paint is however somewhat cooler and the shadows are painted in brown or grey tones rather than red. \nThe x-radiograph shows, that light areas like the flesh paint or the apron were initially laid in more generously and only received their final shape in a more advanced stage of the painting process when adjacent areas were painted. The blocked in areas of the sleeve and the background meet without overlapping. A narrow strip of barely covered ground on the inner side of her right upper arm was incorporated into the representation as a reflection.  \nIn can be observed that the areas of the lace and embroidery on the sleeve of her blouse vary in consistency and the method of application; in part the paint was applied wet-in-wet, sometimes the wet paint was blended with a dry brush, finally the details of the pattern were applied with impasto yellow paint. There is no gilding, light reflexes on the rings and chains were achieved with impasto highlights (presumably lead-tin-yellow)."}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"Artist's insignia on the right edge of the panel: winged serpent with dropped wings, facing left and dated above '1564'; in yellow paint (see Fig. AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Detail_08)\n\n[Kunsthistorisches Museum, revised 2012]","sortingNumber":"1564-009","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"83.50","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Female Portrait","type":"Titel"},{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of a Woman (a Hoffmann by birth from Leipzig?)","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":261},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":523},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":784},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2670,"height":3488},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG886_FR430_2008-02-20_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
