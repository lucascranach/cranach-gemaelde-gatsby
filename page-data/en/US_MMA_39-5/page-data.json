Martin looks to his left while Katharina stares to her right. The bearded Luther is dressed in black as Junker Jörg with his right hand on the pommel of a sword. Along the bottom of the painting, his cropped left hand is positioned just below the sword's cross-guard. The portrait is placed against a green background.

The liquid adhesive was applied warm using a small sable brush. This initial step allowed treatment work to continue without risk of further loss.\n\nCleaning\n\t\t\t\nThe cleaning materials for the Luther panel were identical to those used for Katharina¿s. The dirt film was removed using a pH-neutral detergent and the varnish layers were soluble in organic solvents. Washes of overpaint were encountered throughout the dark tones to mute small abrasions along the wood grain. During cleaning, an area of hardened white overpaint was revealed in the upper-right quadrant. This area required scalpel assistance for removal.\nAs stated in the introduction, 'whole sections of paintings may be overpainted, hiding long-forgotten original intent. Only bits and pieces of information may remain after centuries of former restoration work and damage.' This occurred during the removal of the Luther portrait's varnish and restoration work. The silhouette of a scraped-out coat of arms or seal, and two lines of a missing inscription were discovered in the lower areas.\nFully cleaning the upper sections of both paintings brought out an additional discovery of faint lettering. Only a few letters on the first line of a possible five- or six-line inscription on the Luther portrait were legible 'the letters D O C T O R   A R T   V S  L V' but all of remaining letters, and all of the letters on Katharina's portrait, were illegible. One could reasonably infer that the Latin text on the Luther panel originally read DOCTOR MARTINVS LVTHER.\n\nX-Rays/Infrared Photography\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn order to determine a possible solution to the missing inscriptions, two further investigative procedures were undertaken: X-rays and infrared photography. X-rays allow conservators to understand certain aspects of a painting's condition history. They can detect holes, tears, under-drawings, and areas of former restoration work.\nX-rays will pass through most objects but are blocked by pigments that contain heavy metals such as lead white; these areas appear white on x-ray film. Unfortunately, the X-rays produced no clarifying information relative to the former inscriptions and only the Katharina panel presented a reasonable image, although the backing cradle severely compromised its resolution. [1]\n\nInfrared photography can be used to 'see' into the layers of a painting providing information that is not visible to the human eye such as under-drawings, variations in composition, and hard-to-read inscriptions. The technique can detect carbon-based materials such as graphite and certain black pigments.\nThe infrared images sharpened the known letters on the first line of the Luther inscription and revealed additional information on the second line. It was now possible to read the letters P R O P H E T [?] probably PROPHETA originally, the Latin word for prophet, and an additional S. The infrared examination of the scraped-out seal, the scraped-out lower two lines, and Katharina's upper inscription offered no clarifying information. [2]\n\nFilling\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFilling has two purposes. It prevents further damage by sealing the edges of holes, tears, and cracks. It is also used to reproduce a sympathetic surface with respect to plane and texture. Minor areas of loss on both panels were filled with gesso, a mixture of marble dust and a 1:7 gelatin adhesive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nVarnishing\n\t\t\t\t\t\nA brush coat of Winsor & Newton non-yellowing varnish was applied to the paint surfaces. Varnish is applied for several reasons. First, it reinstates the richness of the paint by allowing the darks to have their proper tone. Second, it keeps dirt and air pollution off the picture surface. Third, the surface coating protects the paint layer from damage caused by abrasion, moisture, and accidental accretions. The varnish also creates an ethical buffer between the original paint layer and the retouching or inpainting. Conservators do not paint directly on the original paint surface. The work is done on top of an isolating varnish and can be removed by simply removing the underlying varnish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nRetouching\n\t\t\t\t\t\nRetouching is carried out to correct visual inconsistencies caused by inherent structural problems or surface damage. Its purpose is to reduce or eliminate these inconsistencies. It is applied only to areas of loss and should never extend over the original paint. The retouching was completed using Maimeri conservation pigments. These pigments are both color- and light-fast offering confidence that the restoration areas will remain consistent over time. Also, the pigments are soluble in mineral spirits. This relatively weak solvent permits safe and easy removal without risk of injury to the paint surface. [3]\nMs. Jane Connell, director of collections and exhibitions, and senior curator, for the Muskegon Museum of Art, guided the retouching to include: leaving the abraded upper inscriptions in place for they did not detract from the paintings' overall aesthetic balance; softening the visual inconsistencies in the upper-right corner of the female portrait; and fully retouching the lower scraped-out losses on the Luther portrait for these areas were visually dominant and visually disruptive.
