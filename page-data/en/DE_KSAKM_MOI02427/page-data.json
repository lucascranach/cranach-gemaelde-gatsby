The lily and sword normally included in the iconography are missing here. Christ is framed by an aureole of clouds flanked either side by angels blowing trombones. An angel is positioned at the centre with two open books that may be a reference to the Old and New Testaments. The saved souls are shown as classical nudes, standing either side of Christ. On the lower half of the image the righteous are directed towards heaven by angels. Two figures turn towards the viewer and their facial characteristics suggest these are portraits. The damned souls on the right hand side are driven into the flames of Hell by demons and the pope and a cardinal, representing the Roman Catholic Church are clearly visible in the front row. The bottom edge of the pictorial space is occupied by a family of kneeling donors. At the left is the father flanked by the family coats of arms, while the mother together with their two daughters is shown on the right with her family coat of arms. \n[Daniel Görres, cda
