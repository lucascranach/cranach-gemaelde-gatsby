In this capacity it could be used equally by followers of both the new and old faiths. Within the oeuvre of Cranach and his workshop there are similar representations that sometimes show Albrecht of Brandenburg, a key opponent to Luther (FR 183), and sometimes the protestant Prince Joachim I of Anhalt (private collection) under the cross. Already in a woodcut from about 1515 the electoral secretary Georg Spalatin is shown in a similar fashion. \n[Görres, Exhib. Cat.

Drops of blood cover Christ's slender body, the stigmata mark his limbs and his loincloth puffs out ornamentally either side of him in a fashion characteristic of Cranach. Christ's head is inclined to the left, where the donor is shown with a closed book in his hands and in accordance with the words of the psalm he recognises Christ as his Redeemer. \n[Görres, Exhib.
