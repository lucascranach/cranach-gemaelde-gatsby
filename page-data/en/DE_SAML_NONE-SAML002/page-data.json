In his hand he offers her a gold and ruby ring, either as a love token or as an offer of marriage. In her hand she holds a posy of red carnations, traditional symbols of both love and affection, entwined with daisies, tokens both of love and fertility, and also of innocence and sincerity. At their feet a wine cooler sits in the spring, while a silver gilt goblet is perched upon a rock beside them. The two lovers remain unknown, and it is most unlikely that this panel was originally painted as a formal betrothal portrait. Behind them, the gentleman’s horse is tethered to a tree, and his knowing look at the spectator, coupled with the unambiguous symbolism of the tree branch, offers a humorous erotic undertone, although given that daisies were also symbolic of innocence, perhaps a moral warning of virtue in danger as well.\n[Sotheby's online database: \nhttps://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/old-masters-evening-l18033/lot.12.html] (accessed 13.09.2019)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 59.4 x 39 cm.; 23 3/8  x 15 3/8  in.\n[Sotheby's online database:\nhttps://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/old-masters-evening-l18033/lot.12.html] (accessed 13.09.2019]","exhibitionHistory":"Birmingham 1951–52\nOxford, Ashmolean Museum, on loan (as Lucas Cranach the Elder and studio)","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4767,"height":7240}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":304},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none_2018_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":608},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none_2018_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":911},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none_2018_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4767,"height":7240},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none_2018_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002_FR-none_2018_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_SAML_NONE-SAML002","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Hans Kemmer","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Hans Kemmer","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Emmendörfer, attribution via oral communication, 2018]\n(?)

There is an even, minute craquelure throughout. Much beautiful detail remains perfectly intact, both in the landscape and in the figures themselves, particularly in the very fine portraits, while there are a few little minor retouchings in the red drapery of the lady and in the man's deep red cloak. The fine detail of the landscape is well preserved almost throughout. The upper sky has been quite widely strengthened in the past largely covering the tiny craquelure, while just a few more recent tiny retouches can be seen under ultra violet in the well preserved lower sky.
