[1] The figure of Saint Paul clad in armour and the horse from which he falls are particularly similar, and there is a clear relationship between the two works. Both compositions are highly inventive, and find no obvious echoes in repeated compositions emanating from the Cranach workshop or wider circle of influence. Both pictures mark a decisive break with the style of the artist's father Lucas Cranach the Elder. \n[1] Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum [DE_BStGS-GNMN_Gm226]\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-evening-sale-l08033/lot.63.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 93.5 x 83 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-evening-sale-l08033/lot.63.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","exhibitionHistory":"New York, 1960","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":6271,"height":7059}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":225},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":450},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":675},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":6271,"height":7059},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P268","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-evening-sale-l08033/lot.63.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32402","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]},{"constituentId":"113291","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-evening-sale-l08033/lot.63.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 93.5 x 83 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-evening-sale-l08033/lot.63.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1549","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P268","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P268_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Conversion of Saint Paul"},"objectId":951876,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- Count Salemfels (former Director of the Prague Museum)\n- his daughter, P.M.
