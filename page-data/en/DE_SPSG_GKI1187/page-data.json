They were distributed in books for the education of princes (>>Fürstenspiegel<<) as well as being used to decorate representative rooms in castles and town halls. Associated with the depiction of these narratives was the idea that the virtues and vices of illustrious figures could provide standards and role models for political action. The exempla of virtue could on the one hand have a moralizing-didactic character by illustrating correct behavior to the princes or councillors; they could also serve the legitimization of political power and interests by justifying the ruler’s virtuous behavior. The panels in Berlin illustrate the monarchical virtues of moderation, wisdom, justice and courage. […]\n\nIt may be assumed, that the complex content and composition of the four paintings were based on a design by the father. These were then executed rapidly – probably under the supervision of Lucas Cranach the Younger - by workshop members. This would explain slight inconsistencies in the proportions and other formal details. Friedländer, Rosenberg and Schade on the other hand suggest that the painting is an autographed work by the son.‘\n\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat. Berlin 2009, 200-201, no.
