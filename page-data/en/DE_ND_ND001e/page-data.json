With a blessing he cured the sick child lying at his feet. The mother of the child kneels in prayer behind his cushion. An expansive landscape is visible beyond a low wall in the background. The panel has a half-rounded top above which organic ornamentation is visible. In imitation of the carved figures in the central shrine the artist represents the figure like a statue standing on a pedestal. When open the altar shows scenes with St Valentine and two other saints who were popes.  \nVerso: the reverse of the wing shows two scenes from the life of St Nicolas. These belong to four episodes from the legend of the saint, that together with four further depictions from the lives of other Religious role models are visible when the altar is closed. The upper field shows the miracle of the wheat. The legend reports that 100 bushels of flour were enough for Nicholas to feed the starving for a month. When the captain who had donated the 100 bushels arrived at his destination the weight of the load had not changed. In the lower field Nicholas saves three innocent knights from being condemned to death and also helped to liberate other innocent prisoners by appearing to the emperor in a dream. \n[Görres, cda
