The shine of the varnish varies, with the difference most apparent in the area where the curtain was painted. Here much coarser brushstrokes were used, which may indicate a subsequent intervention on the painting. The tone of varnish oxidation is clearly observed in areas where the crowns prevented UV rays from penetrating. In the central portion of the painting there are tiny perforations; the larger two (1 cm in diameter) are located near Mary¿s head and the head of Child Jesus ¿ in the areas where crowns were once attached. Judging from the damage it can be concluded that the position of the crowns was changed several times and that they were fastened at two points. Present are also deformations in the canvas support, in the form of creases in the area where the crowns were attached, as well as deformations caused by indentation of the stretcher laths. Damage to the painted layer due to different straining of the canvas and the painted layer is visible along the top and bottom edge, in the width of the stretcher lath. Large craquelures are evenly distributed across the entire surface of the painting and are visibly different in the area of the curtain. In the central portion there are visible craquelures caused by an impact. Minor mechanical injuries of the red-toned preparation can also be observed.\nAlong the top and left edge there are visible traces of blue paint applied to tighten the canvas on the stretcher more precisely, and from the damage along the canvas edges it can be concluded that the painting was mounted on the stretcher twice. The painting was found mounted on a loose wooden stretcher, onto which a linen cloth was attached from the back in order to support the crown and the heart from the rear; a surviving metal nut points to this conclusion. There are visible perforations for fastening the crowns. The painting support is a fine, evenly woven canvas made of two pieces with a seam that runs down the middle of the painting; it is attached to the stretcher with small industrial nails. On the matching metal crowns and the heart a thick layer of dust and dirt is visible as well as areas with a layer of metal oxidation. That the position of the crowns and the way they were mounted was changed on several occasions is indicated by the fact that the bolts on both sides of the crowns are cut, while in the painting there are visible perforations for those same bolts. On the left side, however, near both crowns, there are entire bolts but no perforations were made in the painting in order for the crowns to be fastened at these points.\nNear the large crown a cross is missing, and mechanical damage is visible on the decorative stones in the crowns.\n [Ivana Sambolic, Izvješce o provedenim konzervatorsko-restauratorskim radovima na slikama Marija Pomocnica i Sv.

The position of the crowns was chosen according to the existing holes and their matching with the location of the bolts on the crowns. Protection was then attached to th reverse of the painting. With the work completed, the painting was packed in bubble wrap.
