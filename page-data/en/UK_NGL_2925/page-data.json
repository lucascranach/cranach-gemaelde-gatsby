The painting has rightly been accepted as the work of Lucas Cranach the Elder, despite its condition.\n[1] [Schuchardt 1851, 207–8]; the painting listed on p. 207 is described as ‘ein tuch’, i.e. a painting on canvas or linen cloth; the other is part of a list of ‘tücher’.

She clasps the forearm of a girl in her right hand while a smaller boy clings to her left leg and she suckles a baby (of indeterminate sex) at her left breast. All the figures are represented naked, but the mother has a transparent veil which extends over her forehead and from behind her neck over both shoulders, part wrapping around the arm holding the child in the form of a sling, and part extending over the front of her body and right leg. She also wears two necklaces, a choker with a stone around her neck and a gold chain with large links over her shoulders. Her hair is fair and is bound with a black band. The hair of her daughter (and of the other two infants) is also fair. In an echo of her mother¿s pose, the small girl carries a female doll in her right arm, dressed in a long square-necked dress with a white high-necked blouse underneath. The doll¿s hair is also held back with a black band. The figures stand on stony brown ground against a black background, both of which consist largely of overpaint. Although it is reasonable to assume that this repainting follows the original, this cannot be proven to be the case. However, many other paintings by Cranach of such subjects include similar dark backgrounds, for instance classical subjects such as Hercules or Venus and Cupid.\n[Susan Foister, `Lucas Cranach the
