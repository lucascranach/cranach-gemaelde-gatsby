A small boy, wearing only in a thin gauzy tunic stands between them and offers St Dorothy a basket of flowers – an attribute associated with her. St Margaret’s dragon is positioned happily at her feet, while a less common vanitas symbol, that of the mask is placed prominently on the ground in the foreground. The figurative group is set against the backdrop of an expansive mountainous landscape with a town visible in the valley and a fortress on a hill to the right.\n[cda 2021]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 121 x 90.3 x 0.1 cm (thinned original panel)/ 1.4 cm (including the auxilary support, a blockboard consisting of spruce wood)\n[Cat.
