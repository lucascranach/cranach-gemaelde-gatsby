It was a motif repeated several times in Cranach's workshop. \nThe Latin inscription on the fountain represents the lasciviously smiling nymph's words as she looks out at us through half-closed eyes: 'I, the nymph of the sacred fountain, am resting; do not disturb me.'\nSuch seductive nudes are characteristic of Cranach's mature style. \n[Walker Art Gallery, revised 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions

A letter of 9 March 1858 from M. Bewley & Son to the President of the Institution refers to a 'painting belonging to the late T. Winstanley Esq. which was lent by him to the Institution a long time ago - the subject a nude female fugure supposed to be the portrait of Lucca Cranach' (University of Liverpool Library, Archives and Special Collections, LRI 1/3/2). A monogram in grey-white paint consisting of the letters FW or EW was discovered in the lower left corner of WAG 1223 during surface cleaning in 2012-2013.\n[Joseph Sharples, Walker Art Gallery; https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=243693&sos=0]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"92, fn. 19","referenceId":"30042","title":"Cat.

The top board seems to have been thinner than the bottom at the right side, to a maximum extent of about 2 – 2.5mm or so, hence the step. The fill is of unknown date, and while not analysed, appears to be of chalk and animal glue with unidentified fibres mixed into it.

The fill over the stepped join to the reverse is clearly visible as more dense material, and it shows the tapering nature of the step. The join line itself is apparently sound, although the join faces vary in thickness between about 5mm down to 2.5mm or thereabouts. The working tool marks on the reverse are visible. Less clear is the nature of the ground preparation – some of the subtle differences in density may well be due to variations in the ground layer across the picture. A dense white mark at mid right may be the remnant of a small pin or nail used for past framing, while that at the lower right corner is an area of fill. There are scattered old paint losses, and a damage to the left side of the lower edge. Some other less distinct areas across the paint layer seem to show possible thinning or old damage to the paint which have been restored, for instance to the lower left corner. \nThe most obvious possible change in the design is the line of the sitters’ proper left lower leg, where the X-ray shows a position of the leg slightly further to the right than visible in the painted image. \n(Details: 59733 – X-ray detail lower left, 59734 – X-ray detail lower right, 59735 – X-ray detail upper left, 59736 – X-ray detail upper right)\nX-ray detail of initials under overpaint, lower left corner (see also: normal light detail of initials after overpaint removal):\nBoth the above images relate to the discovery on the X-radiograph of painted initials, either E.W. or possibly F.W., at the lower left corner.
