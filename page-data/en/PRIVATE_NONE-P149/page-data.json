While the debate surrounding the exact meaning of Dürer’s print is still very much alive, it is generally agreed that melancholy, which was perceived during the Middle Ages as a sinful humour akin to sloth and denial of God, is presented in Durer’s image as a condition necessary to achieving artistic, scientific and philosophical genius. However, this positive humanist interpretation of melancholy was still far from meeting with general consensus and one of its strongest adversaries was the great religious reformer Martin Luther, a close friend of Cranach. Indeed, in his writings Luther frequently described melancholy as a devilish affliction: ‘All heaviness of mind and melancholy come from the devil; especially these thoughts, that God is not gracious unto him’ (M. Luther, The Table Talk of Martin Luther, ed. and translated by W. Hazlitt, Philadelphia, 1883, p. 334).\n[...]\nThe inclusion of the fifteen boisterous children in this painting remains enigmatic. The design would appear to derive from an engraving of the same subject by Andrea Mantegna, which is now lost but is recorded in the 1685 inventory of Cesare d’Ignazio d’Este in Ferrara: ‘sixteen children who are playing music and dancing, with Melancolia written above’ (inventory published in G. Campori, Raccolta di Cataloghi ed Inventarii inediti, Modena, 1870, p. 328). They may be included to represent merriment and light-heartedness, in contrast to the morose state of the winged allegory. \n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1532,"dated":"about 1533","end":1534,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1533","end":"1533","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"after [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 125, No. 277] dated '1533';  [Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017]","text":"1533"}],"remarks":"[cda 2017]"},"description":"'An image charged with dynamism, fantasy and eroticism, Melancholia is one of the most iconic and enigmatic subjects in Cranach's oeuvre. Its iconography, which is highly original, complex and somewhat unsettling, warrants a detailed description. Set in an austere chamber, with a small opening to the right on to a rocky landscape, a winged woman sits, dressed in a lavish vermilion dress, her long hair sensuously flowing down her shoulders, seemingly preoccupied with the sharpening of a wooden stick. In front of her, eight nude children dance frantically to the sound of a drum and pipe, played by two of their companions, while five further children have collapsed in exhaustion on the floor. Dominating the upper third of the composition, a threatening black cloud filled with wild and fanciful creatures permeates the space. Alluring young women, hovering on flying carpets and charging horses, use their carnal charms to subjugate men, while hybrid demons, reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch's most frightening creations, complete the devilish procession. The head of an old bearded man emerges ominously from the far right of the cloud, with the word MELANCHOLIA projecting from his lips towards the winged figure below.'\n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 52.4 x 74 cm \n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017] \ndiffering dimensions at FR: 62 x 84 cm \n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 125, No. 277]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4934,"height":3455}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":140},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":280},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":420},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4934,"height":3455},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":140},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":280},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":420},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4934,"height":3455},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"Next to the cloud: 'MELANCHOLIA'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P149","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017] \n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 125, No. 277]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017]\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 125, No. 277]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 52.4 x 74 cm \n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-melancholia-5813547-details.aspx; accessed 29 Nov 2017] \ndiffering dimensions at FR: 62 x 84 cm \n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 125, No. 277]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1533","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P149","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P149_FR277_2014_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Melancholia"},"objectId":919449,"objectName":"FR277","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- (probably) Granville Penn (1761-1844), London, and from 1834, Stoke Park, Buckinghamshire, and Pennsylvania Castle, Portland\n- Christie's, London, 10 May 1828, lot 119, 'Melancholy - A Woman with Children dancing and a Vision above' (unsold)\n- Christie's, London, 3 April 1830, lot 72 (£6 to Wasse)\n- private collection, Southam Delabere, near Cheltenham, by 1906\n- with Paul Cassirer, Berlin, 1924\n- F.
