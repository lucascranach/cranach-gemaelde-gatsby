He holds his son in his arms and the Holy Ghost hovers in front of him in the form of a white dove. God the Father is enveloped in a sumptuous red robe decorated with precious stones along the hem and looks at the viewer. His grey haired head is crowned with an equally opulent tiara. Christ lies on his lap with outstretched arms, his body covered with wounds and blood. His body with only a loincloth covering it is turned towards the Holy Ghost as is his gaze. The central group is framed by a Gloriole, flanked at the sides by swirling cloud formations. Ten cherubs with red, green, blue and orange wings look out from the clouds.   \n\n[Heiser 2013, 9]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 83 x 136 x 6 cm\n[Heiser 2013,

This corresponds with the traditional use of a glue-chalk ground on wooden panels. The ground was then carefully smoothed, only isolated marks are visible.

In addition to acting as an isolating layer it also increased the luminous reflectance of the ground layer for the paint layer, which followed. \n[Heiser 2013, 38]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The painting appears to have been executed in oil or oil/resin. Tempera may have been employed for the underlying layers. Lead white, lead-tin yellow and copper green were identified in a cross-section of a paint sample from the green angel’s wing. This corresponds with the pigments used by the Cranach workshop. The paint application is smooth and was executed in thin layers with very few areas of impasto and yet separate areas have been worked up differently. Whereas the clouds and the exterior of God’s coat were laid in with a layer of black paint the blue wings exhibit an ochre underpaint. In the lighter areas the white imprimatura was left visible. A flat application of paint was applied over the underpaint and was subsequently modulated. The modulation of light and dark was achieved with dark glazes, white highlights and further coloured glazes and the white imprimatura lends the whole painting a particular luminosity. The silk material of God’s undergarment was created in the manner mentioned. In 1555 Johann Neudorffer noted that Lucas Cranach could paint the best velvet. The material quality of the painted velvet was achieved by applying red glazes over a black underpaint and completing the effect with bright red highlights. The prevailing black underpaint is a technique used in the Cranach workshop, which was also easy for workshop members to imitate. On the hem of the coat a brownish-orange tone was used, that is typical of the Wittenberg workshop for draperies and jewellery. Elements like the hair or the decoration on the coat and God the Father’s tiara are represented with great attention to detail and are rich in contrast. The intention to create different effects is reflected in both a variation in the methods of paint application as well as the manner in which the painting was worked up: softly blurred transitions feature as does brushwork employing stipples and dashes, and less nuanced areas contrast with calligraphic representation of form. \nThe flesh paint consists of brown and red glazes applied over light coloured flesh paint. Lead white highlights are only visible to a small extent with the naked eye or in the x-radiograph, suggesting a rapid paint application in not many layers. Heydenreich states that the more complicated painting technique was reserved for the more superior commissions. The sequence of paint application can be established from the overlapping of areas of paint. It corresponds to a greater extent with the usual procedure in the Cranach workshop. First the initial layer of flesh paint and the gloriole were applied. The infrared reflectogram shows that both extend beyond the lines of the underdrawing. The underpaint in the background and the blue angel’s wings followed, while holding single areas in reserve. An unmodulated paint layer was applied at this stage to other areas. The subsequent layers of glaze were complemented by details and dark contours that were in part painted wet-in-wet.\nDuring the painting process the artist corrected forms defined by the underdrawing, which '[reflects Cranach‘s] spontaneous working method and his urge to achieve artistic perfection.' The division of labour so typical of Cranach’s workshop practice cannot be reconstructed on the panel from Ehrenberg depicting the Holy Trinity as little difference in the painterly quality could be established.    \n[Heiser 2013, 41-42]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The frame is made of a light hardwood, probably lime or maple. It consists of five elements. The x-radiograph shows that these elements were butt-joined. Any further indication about the glue type could not be established through the compact structure of the coating. The frame is only 3 cm wide. \nWith its simple profile consisting of a large cove and a flat ledge the frame corresponds with the profile of former shrine cases and can be found on other frames from the Cranach workshop. The uncoated transverse section of the the batten at the bottom right exhibits marks from a flat carving tool. It is probably the original frame, which was attached to the front of the panel with nails. On the one hand the original paint layers exhibit a barbe corresponding with the frame and there are no marks on the reverse from former battens. \n[Heiser 2013, 37]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The composition is fixed in the underdrawing, which is visible to the naked eye and almost completely revealed in the infrared reflectogram. It is a generous and energetic drawing executed with a pointed brush in a black fluid drawing medium. The outlines and a few inner forms were defined with single, dynamic lines without employing hatching-strokes. There are a few rare corrections of shapes or forms as can be observed in Christ’s leg and the arrangement of the folds in the loincloth. The ends of the folds are indicated with small hooks and arcs.\nThe underdrawing was considered during the painting process without being adhering to exactly or being completely binding. The expressions on the angels’ faces have been retained, but the heads were generally painted slightly larger than they had been drawn. The same can be observed with the wings of the angels. Some change completely in size and position in the painted version. The painted version does not follow the border of the clouds established in the underdrawing and the painted shape of the Gloriol is not recorded in the underdrawing. There is no indication that the design was transferred from a pre-existing template. The few, confident lines and rare corrections with regards the angels‘ faces and Christ’s body suggest, that the underdrawing was developed freely on the ground with reference to a pre-existing design. Exemplary is the depiction of Christ’s face. The direction of his gaze is conveyed by only two circles and the indicated eyebrows. The great similarity of the painted version with other depictions of Christ suggests that the artist drew on a large repertoire of forms. God the Father’s head on the other hand, which is a significant element in the composition, is drawn with great attention to detail. The face is also similar to the general type of other Holy Trinity images from Cranach the Elder’s workshop. A comparison with the painting of ‘The Holy Trinity adored by the Virgin and St Sebastian’ in the Museum der Bildenden Künste in Leipzig makes this particularly evident. The considerable difference in the attention to detail in the underdrawing suggests that a less precise design existed for God’s face and that the underdrawing required further elaboration in this area. It is also possible that it was drawn by two different hands. \nThe stylistic qualities of the underdrawing support the attribution of the panel to the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder. A rational underdrawing type influenced by the workshop practice was characteristic for the years between 1510-1520. The style of the underdrawing on the painting from Ehrenberg suggests it was created in the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder. In the years between 1510 and 1520 Cranach’s underdrawing was less spontaneous than in previous years when the workshop was smaller. Common to both Cranach and his workshop members are ‘the sparse definition of inner forms, the linear outer forms, the crescent-shaped arcs, the use of loops and open hooks to indicated folds and the omission of hatching-strokes.’\n[Heiser 2013, 40-41]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["04_X-radiograph/DE_SKD_SKS_SAV2200_FR-none_2013_X-radiograph"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden","role":"created by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2013","endDate":"2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"18.
