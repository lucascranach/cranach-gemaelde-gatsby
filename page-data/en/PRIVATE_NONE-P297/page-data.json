By no later than 1509 with the depiction of Venus (FR 22, St. Petersburg) Cranach's paintings begin to reflect distinctive Italian influences. The present painting confirms that Cranach engaged with contemporary Italian painting, adapting the stylistic characteristics and specific forms. Parallels between ‘The Virgin and Child with the infant St John’ by Perugino in the Städel Museum discussed by Bodo Brinkmann within the context of the exhibitions in Frankfurt and London are clearly recognisable. These include the figures‘ silhouettes, that have been shifted out of symmetry, the broad folded back area of green lining, the thin strip of hem on the left shoulder and the decoration in the Virgin’s hair as well as the golden trimmings and haloes, and the use of the common iltalian practice of gold tooling. The cloth wrapped around St John’s torso also appears to have been borrowed from an Italian model and finally the childrens‘ low hairline and comparatively short hair follows this pattern. Even the blackish blue sky, which in Perugino’s painting is brightened through pink to yellow, is repeated here in a milder form and as such for the first time on a painting by Cranach. Details like the cumulus clouds piled up to a point appear borrowed from a model as these appear on works by numerous italian artists (e. g. Pierro della Francesca St Jerome, Berlin; Cristoforo Canozi da Lendinara, The Crucifixion, Verona).\n\n\n\nJan Wittmann concluded in 1998 that Cranach borrowed the motif of ‚The Virgin and Child with the infant St John‘ (PRIVATE_NONE-P046) from Perugino’s paintings of the Virgin, while Brinkmann considers it to be a free interpretation of a model from the circle of Perugino. Without doubt together with the Venus from 1509 and the so-called Galluzzo Madonna (about 1514) the composition of this painting documents quite impressively that Cranach knew and adapted works by his Italian contemporaries.\n\n\n[unpublished examination report G.

As the final composition of this painting only appears to have been defined during the painting process, while the underdrawing for the ‘Virgin and Child and the infant St John (about 1512 PRIVATE_NONE-P046) was adopted without alterations it may be assumed that the present painting was probably the earliest version of this composition.\n\n[unpublished examination report, G.

The support was probably thinned and attached to a blockboard in the twentieth century. The open joints and losses were probably treated within this context. Retouching from various campaigns is visible under UV-light, particularly along the joints and the edges as well as isolated in other areas of the painted surface. The painting is slightly compromised by the damage to Christ's right eye, the Virgin's eyebrow and the areas of shadow in the flesh paint. Due to the natural ageing process, which causes increased transparency the underdrawing is partially visible with the naked eye through the paint layers (e. g. the virgin's face). A similar network of cracks has been observed on other works from the Cranach workshop.  \n\n[unpublished examination report, G.

The wood species is a soft wood, probably lime. The planks are aligned horizontally, transverse to the greatest expansion of the wood. The edges of the planks are not parallel. There is no evidence for a fibre application. The panel was thinned at a later stage on the reverse and reinforced with a blockboard. There is nothing to indicate that the dimensions of the panel were altered. \n\nThe proportions and the size of the support, the arrangement of the planks and their widths correspond roughly with those of the 'Virgin and Child and the infant St John' (about 1512, 75.9 x 59.4 cm, private collection, lucascranach.org/PRIVATE_NONE-P046). Lime wood was frequently used as a support for paintings north of the Alps. This was the preferred wood species in the Wittenberg workshop between 1505 and 1522 and in the period that followed was alongside beech wood the species most often used. The carpenter employed by Cranach between 1505 and 1512 (probably Michel Tischer) generally aligned the short sides of the planks, irrespective of whether the panel was to be used for a portrait or landscape format. This carpenter also frequently employed planks the edges that were not parallel and widths between 6 and 22 cml. Lime wood panels constructed after 1512 generally exhibit a different method of alignment, being aligned according to the longest side of the panel. When Cranach moved his workshop from the castle in Wittenberg to the town he probably employed another carpenter, whose working method differed. The horizontal alignment of the planks of this panel suggest that it was constructed before or about 1512. However a later date of production cannot be excluded."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The panel has a white ground; it is probably a chalk ground (XRF analysis: calcium). The application of the ground does not extend to the edge of the panel, suggesting that the panel was fitted in a temporary frame at this stage. There is a barbe visible along all four edges. There is a black paint layer covering the bare wood along the edges of the panel."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"Using infrared reflectography a black underdrawing executed with a brush was made visible. The freehand and confident drawing of the figures concentrates on fixing the main contours and essential details with curved lines. The children's arms and hands are described with a few cursive lines and corrected during the painting process. Likewise the faces exhibit an econoomical initial design, which was subsequently defined in more detail during the painting process. \n\nThe majority of paintings by Cranach and his workshop from the period between 1510 - 1515 exhibit an economical underdrawing with a black medium. Particularly after 1510 a focus on essential contours employing short curved lines can be observed. The stylistic features of the underdrawing on this panel are similar to those on other compositions attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder (e. g.  FR 1978, 18, 20, 22, 29, http://lucascranach.org/F_MBAAB_896-1-54a, b)."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"To create the faces an initial pale admixture of lead white and vermilion pigments was employed. Shadows were modeled in grey paint and semi-transparent brownish-black glazes, with accents applied in reddish paint and highlights in pale flesh paint. The eyes including the eyelashes and reflections were painted with routine. The eyeball contains in addition to white a significant quantity of blue pigment (azurite). The beard and hair were executed in different colours and intensity using lead-tin-yellow (XRF) and defined with fine, directional strokes. In some areas (e. g. the head of the infant St John) short and broad dark yellow hair is covered with longer elegantly curved pink strands. \n\nThe sky and the landscape in the background have a grey underpaint (white and black pigments). A gradual gradation of tonal values between the zenith (grey-black) and the horizon (white) can be observed. Relatively coarse and intensely coloured particles of azurite (XRF) were subsequently used in admixtures of differing ratios with lead white and dabbed or applied in strokes. The horizon was brightened with a tone passing from pink to lead-tin-yellow (XRF). The clouds were applied wet-in-wet and the contours were blended with a soft brush. Minor corrections with a finely ground and less intense blue pigment were carried out on the hills. The group of trees in the middleground was executed over a black underpaint, employing different admixtures of light green and a final green glaze. \n\nNo significant changes were made to the composition during the painting process. A grey underpaint in the sky is often found on verified paintings by Cranach and his workshop. Likewise the use of various brushes and methods of application is a common feature of the workshop practice. \n\n\n\n\n\nShellgold\n\nThe haloes as well as the hems of veil, coat and dress are executed using shell gold - gold powder ground with an (oil) medium. Unusual in this context is the subsequent and confident execution of outlines on the haloes in pink as well as yellow and pink strands of hair. \n\nIn comparison with other gilding techniques employed in the Cranach workshop the use of shell gold is rare. The painting process is generally completed with the gold highlights. Here (as with PRIVATE_NONE-P046) subsequent accents were executed in paint. \n\n[unpublished examinatioin report, G.
