The original dimensions of the panel probably correspond with those of the panels in Prague and Cologne (Lempertz).\nUnderdrawing executed with a stylus (dark chalk) on paintings by Lucas Cranach and the workshop from before 1530 are rarely found and are more common later. From the 1510s for example the painting of ‘The Virgin and Child‘ (1518, DE_WRMK_WRM3207) exhibits a similar tentative underdrawing with a stylus (dark chalk) and isolated indications of contours.\nThe identified pigments were employed in European panel paintings before 1750 and were also frequently used in the Cranach workshop.[2]\nThe technique for the paint application corresponds with the usual practice in the Cranach workshop. Shapes and design elements can be found on other Wittenberg workshop productions. Although the original quality of the execution is compromised in some areas due to damage the eyes, hair and robes among others correspond in their execution and quality to the works of Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop (see e. g. St Jerome, St Leopold, 1515, Vienna). The execution of this painting appears to be of considerably higher quality than the versions in Prague and Cologne (Lempertz). \nThe insignia, which was executed employing lead-tin-yellow, corresponds with the type found on other works by Lucas Cranach the Elder. No signature is documented on the panels in Prague and Cologne (Lempertz).\nIn my opinion the present painting is a work by Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop from about 1515 – 1520. Previous damage inflicted on the painting and discoloured retouches currently compromise its aesthetic appearance. \n[1] see Heydenreich, G., Lucas Cranach the Elder, Painting materials, techniques and workshop practice, Amsterdam 2007, p. 43.\n[2] Heydenreich 2007\n[Heydenreich, examination report, 30.08.2015]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1510,"dated":"about 1515 - 1520","end":1525,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Heydenreich, examination report, 30.08.2015]"},"description":"The wooden panel depicts the Mocking of Christ set in an interior.

The top edge of the panel was cropped at a later stage by c. 5-6 cm.

The x-radiograph shows numerous worm channels running throughout the entire panel. In the area of Christ's head, including the hand with the recorder, there is a large and coarsely retouched loss in the paint layer, which may be related to the instability of the wooden support.\n\nIn addition the painted surface is abraded in many places, noticeably in the heads, particularly that of Christ as well as the hands and the knee of the ruffian at the front edge. The green tones in particular appear to have discoloured (brown) with age. The yellowed varnish, abrasion, discoloured retouches as well as the partial thinning of the varnish contribute to the overall patchy and disfigured appearance of the painting.

Here zinc white was probably employed for retouching.\nThe flesh tones were modulated employing pink flesh paint and brown shadow tones. While some faces and hands appear skillfully executed others, like the hands of the ruffian at the left, seem rather roughly painted. In numerous faces the confidently/masterfully drawn details of eyelashes and eyebrows have survived. In other areas the detailed drawing appears to have been less distinct or been lost as the result of later intervention. The paint for many of the robes, e. g.
