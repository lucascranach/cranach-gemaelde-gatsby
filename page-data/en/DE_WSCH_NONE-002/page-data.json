He looks up at St John, who is identified by his brown fur gown and red coat. [...] Here John kneels on the bank and pours water over Christ's head out of a brown jug. Christ holds his hands in an attitude of prayer in front of his chest. An angel stands at the left with green wings and a cross on his forehead. His festive red robe with braid and green tassels emphasizes the significance of God the Son's initiation. Like an assistant to the baptism the angel holds Christ's grey gown over his arm. At the right behind a bush two men stand and bear witness. They probably represent the foster father Joseph and the priest Zachariah. \n[Meinel 2017, 60-63]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 132 x 133 cm\n[Meinel 2017, 60-63]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":6124,"height":7098}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":231},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":461},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":692},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":5294,"height":6102},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":232},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":464},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":695},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":6124,"height":7098},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3985,"height":4501}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":226},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/03_IRR/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_IRR-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":452},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/03_IRR/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_IRR-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":678},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/03_IRR/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_IRR-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3985,"height":4501},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/03_IRR/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_IRR-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none/03_IRR/DE_WSCH_NONE-002_FR-none_2016-08_IRR.dzi"}}]},"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_WSCH_NONE-002","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Wolfgang Krodel the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Wolfgang Krodel the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Meinel 2017, 60-63]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"164843","details":[{"name":"Wolfgang Krodel d.
