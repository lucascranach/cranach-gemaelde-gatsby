Technical examinations have shown that the faces of both portraits are almost identical and therefore were probably executed at the same time. However the condition of the painting in Aschaffenburg makes it difficult to determine which of the two paintings served as a template. The portrait of Joachim in Berlin could be the left wing of a diptych or triptych with a sacred representation in the centre and a right wing possibly depicting Cardinal Albrecht or Joachim II; but probably not his wife Elizabeth of Denmark.’\n\n[Elke A.
