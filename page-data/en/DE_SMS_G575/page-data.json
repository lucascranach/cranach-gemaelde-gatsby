The alterations concern above all the colour, the hem of the tucker and the band in the Virgin's hair as well as the veil which falls over the Child's head. \nThe original arrived in Bavaria as a gift from Johann Georg of Saxony to Archduke Leopold V at the beginning of the 17th century and soon after was taken to Innsbruck. A copy remained in Passau. Revered as the Catholic cult image 'Mariahilf' the paintings in Innsbruck and Passau became the goal of many pilgrims and the prototype for numerous repetitions on house walls, in small chapels, parlors and all churchs frequented by the order (see Exhib. Cat Munich 1960, 73f.).\nLatest pictorial type of the Virgin by Cranach, which both in its mood and composition recalls the work of Raphael (see Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 317).'\n \n[Cat.
