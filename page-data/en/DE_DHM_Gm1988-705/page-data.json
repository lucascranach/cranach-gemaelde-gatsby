The top and bottom edges may have been trimmed slightly. The right plank exhibits deformations in the lower area. There are splits in the panel: some splits caused by tension, and a split extending from the top to the bottom of the panel is visible in the area of the join. \n\nPaint Layers: \nA network of cracks with distinct single lines extends over the entire painting. In general the the paint layers exhibit a more widespread common cupping. This feature was probably caused by the tow appplied to the support beneath the paint and ground layers. glazes are very well preserved. There are isolated paint losses (particularly near the edges of the panel) and retouches spread across the painting.\n\nThe present varnish is not original.","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2016","endDate":"2016"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"23.

The sequence of paint application began with the background, followed by the areas of black paint and finally the flesh paint - the hands and the face. In the background the paint was applied rapidly and for the the most part vertically with a larger brush. It appears streaky with impasto brushstrokes and the underlying ground is occasionally visible. Modelling was achieved through the application of highlights and glazes in the shadows over a midtone. Particular striking is the texture in the beard that extends in the opposite direction over the neighbouring section, in this case from the dark clothing to the face. It would appear that linear shapes were painted from the black paint areas into the face and contrary to the usual workshop practice light beard hairs were then painted into the black paint. A compact application of glazes was employed to achieve the texture of the fur.
