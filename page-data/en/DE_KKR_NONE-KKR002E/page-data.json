For the painterly execution of the wings the sculptor secured the cooperation of the best available artists. The first transition of the altar is of a good painterly quality by the workshops of the Master of the Döbelner Altarpiece and the workshop of the Master of the Oberbobritzsch Altarpiece which in terms of style and forms corresponds with that of the beginning of the Renaissance in Freiberg. \nThe interior reveals a central shrine by the workshop of Philipp Koch with a sculptural representation of the patron St Kunigunde and her husband Heinrich II flanked by the Virgin and Child with St Anne and the apostle Thomas. Scenes from the Passion of Christ are arranged either side of the shrine. \n[see: Sandner 1993, 140-143] (Translation, cda 2016)","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1513,"dated":"1513","end":1513,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Corpus dated on reverse]"},"description":"","dimensions":"Dimensions including frame: c. 290 x 100 cm\n[Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Sachsen, revised 2016]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":8044,"height":5644}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":485},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":970},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1455},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2010,"height":4875},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":140},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":281},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":421},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":8044,"height":5644},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Sandner 1993, 143]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Anonymous Master working in Freiberg"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"Deutschland > states > Sachsen > districts (national) > Chemnitz > inhabited places > Rochlitz","term":"Rochlitz","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"Deutschland > states > Sachsen > districts (national) > Chemnitz > inhabited places > Rochlitz","term":"Rochlitz","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[cda 2016]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions including frame: c. 290 x 100 cm\n[Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Sachsen, revised 2016]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1513","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_KKR_NONE-KKR002E_FR-none_2012-04_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Altarpiece of St Kunigunden church [left fixed wing]: Scene from the legend of Kunigunde (The marriage of Kunigunde and Heinrich)"},"objectId":840437,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Ev.-Luth.
