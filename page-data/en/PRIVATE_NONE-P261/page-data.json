These portraits were completed and paid for the following year. The portraits in memory of both the Electors were often accompanied by laudatory verses glued to the panel, as here, and it is highly likely that this painting is one of those commissions. Given the sheer size of this one commission alone, it must be assumed that a large part of these portraits of the Electors were produced with the assistance of Cranach's son and workshop.\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/omp-am1098/lot.15.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:  20.3 x 14.4 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/tableaux-anciens-et-du-xixe-sicle/lot.5.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2124,"height":3135}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":295},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":590},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":886},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2124,"height":3135},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P261","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/omp-am1098/lot.15.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support:  20.3 x 14.4 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/tableaux-anciens-et-du-xixe-sicle/lot.5.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1532","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P261","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Portrait of the Elector Frederick III of Saxony, called the Wise (1463 - 1525)"},"objectId":951853,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- bought in Berlin by the previous owners in the 1980s\n- 10.05.2011 sold by Sotheby's, Amsterdam\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/omp-am1098/lot.15.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"Artist's insignia at left side above shoulder: serpent with elevated wings, facing right and dated '1532'; in black paint\n[cda 2019]","sortingNumber":"1532-022-25","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"20.30","width":"14.40"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of the Elector Frederick III of Saxony, called the Wise (1463 - 1525)","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":295},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":590},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":886},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2124,"height":3135},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P261_FR-none_2011_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
