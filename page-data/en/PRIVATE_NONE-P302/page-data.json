It is evident in many details that in quality they differ from the other versions. For example St Jerome’s hands are less coherent and the arrangement of the folds in the red cloak and white loincloth are less convincing. The quality of the figure of Christ on the other painting is particularly striking and yet the landscape of the Amsterdam version appears to be executed with more attention to detail e. g. the branches on the rocky outcrop and the foliage. However, the abrasion of the paint layers in this area on [P104] must be taken into account as much of the fine detail has been lost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt cannot conclude that this painting was the model for [P104] from the comparison of both versions. The hands both in the underdrawing and in the painted version are more convincingly executed than in the Amsterdam version. It cannot therefore be excluded that [P104] was the model for this painting. However, in this context the uprooted tree in the foreground must also be considered.. While its roots clearly lead to a horizontal trunk the truck is hardly recognizable on the other painting. Therefore it cannot be excluded that another image served as a model for both paintings. \n\n[unpublished examination report G.
