She married Friedrich Drachstedt in 1553 and gave birth to eight children – five sons and three daughters -, before she died on the 30 January in 1573 aged 40. Her eldest daughter, also called Margarethe, married Johannes Bugenhagen the Younger (1527-1594) in 1583. The head of the family Friedrich Drachstedt was an important representative of the Wittenberg society and was blessed with longevity. He studied Law in Wittenberg and later worked as a notary for 48 years at the court, and was also active as a consistory. After Margarethe’s death he married Maria, nee Stettner (1604) on the 16 September 1573. He died on the 8 May 1600.\n[Kazmierczak in: Harasimowicz, Seyderhelm  2015, 138]","year":2015}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1573,"dated":"after 1573","end":1583,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Kazmierczak in: Harasimowicz, Seyderhelm  2015, 137]"},"description":"The panel shows the members of the Drachstedt family kneeling before Christ, who is represented here as the good shepherd. The composition is clearly and symmetrically arranged with Christ occupying the central axis. Various elements in the painting are typical for the biblical shepherd motif, e. g. the hills and source, shown here as a river. The landscape is unusually expansive and bright.
