Friedländer proposed an attribution to Cranach himself, but this has not been followed by any later scholars. Letter dated Amsterdam 23 October 1949. Cited by Grabski, Literature, 1990, p. 126.\n\nIn stylistic terms the date of 1522 on the present panel would seem entirely consistent with a knowledge of Cranach’s work at this date.\n\n\nGiven these numerous parallels with the work of Lucas Cranach we might surmise that the Master of the Piasecka Johnson Madonna may　perhaps have worked in Saxony. His precise identity, however, remains as elusive as ever.\n\n[1] H. Tietze, 'Ein Bild aus der Werkstätte Lukas Cranachs', in Mitteilungen der K. K.

The grassy bank and the posture of the Virgin seated upon it are symbolic of Mary’s humility, while the grapes that she proffers her Son are symbolic of the blood of Christ and hence forewarn of His Passion to come. Iconographically this type, with the Virgin seated full-length in a landscape, was derived in German art from the earlier work of Martin Schongauer (circa 1440–91) and particularly Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), who had both explored the theme in a series of woodcuts and engravings from the 1480s onwards, notably the former’s engraving of the same subject of 1480–81 and the latter’s Holy Family with a dragonfly of 1494–96.　　\n\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.54.html?locale=en] (accessed 13.08.2019)","year":2014}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1517,"dated":"1522","end":1527,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"In a beautiful sunlit landscape, the Virgin Mary is shown seated on a grassy bank, with the Christ Child standing on her lap.

It has been cradled probably in the middle of the last century, and although the faintest trace of curves between cradle bar lines can be seen in a raking light in some places, the cradle has not caused any marked reaction in the original wood, which is remarkably well preserved with no past worm damage. The outer edges of the panel have a narrow unpainted band with some residual priming, from the original structure holding it on the easel. The extraordinary preservation of this painting suggests an exceptionally peaceful, stable background and early history. There has been a recent restoration, with minimal retouching. The central joint has evidently been reglued and there is a band of careful retouching down its full length including the Madonna's eye on the left. Elsewhere however scarcely any other retouching can be seen under ultra violet light. There is one narrow slanting line presumably an old crack or scratch (about five inches long) at the top of the sky on the right, with one other tiny scratch by the horizon on the left. Several brief little old cracks come up from the base edge near the centre on either side of the central joint. There are also one or two surface retouchings in the red drapery at lower right. But these are negligeable imperfections in a quite exceptionally intact painting. The craquelure is extremely fine throughout and the surface has remained crisply defined and pure down to the smallest detail. Within the landscape each leaf is unworn and luminous, as is the beautifully glazed drapery throughout.
