The attribution to Lucas Cranach the Younger was made in the 1920s and is still considered valid today.  (Glück 1911, 221; Cat. Vienna 1928, 59 No. 1468a) \nGustav Glück suggested that the allegory of Virtue may originally have functioned as a sliding cover for a portrait. (Glück 1911, 221; Dülberg 1990, 300)\nThe knight on the right in the foreground, interpreted as a representation of Hercules by Karl Schütz (Schütz 1972, Cat. 26), points with his right hand to the personification of Virtue standing on the steep mountain and in his left hand he holds up a shield for the viewer with the motto 'VIA ARDVA EST SED MANET IN ACVMINE IN EXTIMABILE PRAEMIVM […]' (the path is steep, but an invaluable prize awaits at the top). On the mountain there are two religious men on the path that leads to Virtue. They look up from their scripts, and are accompanied by lance-bearers and knights. They must pass through a narrow entrance designated with the inscription 'DVRATE' (persevere). Virtue stands on a rock on the impassable mountain and points to a palm tree on the peak. A banderole is wound with the inscription 'DEO ET VIRTVTE' (God and virtue) is wound  around the tree, a chain hangs on the right and a laurel wreath on the left. Virtue's gaze follows a figure falling head over heals (also with a book in his hands), who evidently failed to climb the mountain of virtue's steep path. \nThe moral of the allegorical depiction was interpreted by Karl Schütz and  most recently also by Dieter Koepplin with reference to the religio-political context and the resulting conflicts in the year 1548 (The Augsburg Interim in the Empire and the Leipzig Article in Saxony). (Schütz, Exhib. Cat. Vienna 1972, 33; Koepplin 2006, 139-141)\n\n[Hoppe-Harnoncourt, Kunsthistorisches Museum, November 2013] \n[Translation, Smith, cda 2014]","year":2013}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1548,"dated":"1548","end":1548,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"An allegorical depiction showing the personification of Virtue standing on a rocky mountain.

The degree of damage could be establish with the assistance of the x-radiography, which revealed worm channels throughout the entire panel. The panel was thinned and a blind frame made of coniferous wood was glued to the reverse, a ground (probably containing lead white) was applied to the spaces between the vertical members. The date of this intervention was not recorded.  \nThe x-radiograph shows that the worm channels were truncated during the thinning and in part filled with the ground material.\nIn addition the original size of the panel has not been retained. It was trimmed on all four sides and then extended by adding coniferous wood battens. The 0.6-0.7 cm wide battens were each attached to the blind frame with three nails (at regular intervals), subsequently the blind frame and the battens were chamfered. \nThere is a wooden insert measuring 5.5 x 0.6 cm at the bottom right edge, which is not original.\nThis intervention, that was presumably carried out to stabilize the panel, limited its movement and lead to numerous splits in the direction of the grain, some of these have opened on the reverse and exhibit a slight step.   \nWhen the panel was trimmed this caused paint loss along all four edges, which has been filled and retouched. The fills exhibit weak bonding in some places. The retouches extend over the varnish, particularly in the sky, and are for the most part discoloured. \nThe paint layers are abraded along the edges as well as in the area of the rocks (dark glazes), the inscriptions and the clouds. \nThe green glazes of the leaves and blades of grass have become brown.\nThe varnish layers have yellowed and have been unevenly applied. \n\n\n[Tüchler, Kunsthistorisches Museum, revised 2013]\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2014]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2013","endDate":"2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"16.

The sky was painted before the rocks and the foreground. The foliage of the trees was painted in the wet paint of the sky. \nThe landscape was painted over a grey underpaint, which held the light areas like the figure of Hercules in reserve, however in places it extended slightly beyond the form (compare IRR). \nThe small figures in the foreground as well as the architecture were painted in a very calligraphic manner, roofs and windows are defined with minimal linear indication.  \nIn numerous areas the brush was employed sgraffito-like and the wet paint was removed to reveal the dry layer beneath like for example in the area of the armour and the right hand of Hercules where the veins were drawn in the wet paint. \nA later correction can be observed in the female figure. Her left shoulder was made slightly broader. \nAn indication of the pigments employed can be gained on the basis of the absorption of  behaviour of the paint layers revealed in the x-radiograph: the underpaint in the sky and the clouds were painted with an admixture of lead white, the same as the river in the background and the base tone for the coat-of-arms at the bottom right, Hercules' armour as well as the robe of the personified Virtue were probably highlighed with lead-tin-yellow, the lances and the impasto foliage in the foreground also show strong x-ray absorption."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The infrared refectogram did not reveal an underdrawing throughout, however traces were observed in the areas where the painted version deviates from the indicated design. For example the wreath hanging from the tree was positioned slightly higher in the original design and the chain was indicated with rounder forms. In the background landscape the tower on the horizon at the right near the rocky outcrop, was conceived taller than it was realized in the painted version. \nThe personification of Virtue was outlined with rough contour lines before the painting process began, however these appear thicker and contain more pigments. The contours of the rocky plateaus overgrown with foliage were defined with sweeping brush lines, which are today visible to the naked eye through the sky paint. These, like some of the contours of the rocks, were more generously indicated than when executed in paint (see the area around the inscription VIRTUS). \nOn the basis of overlapping and areas held in reserve revealed in the infrared reflectogram the sequence of the painting process can in part be reconstructed. The pale underpaint of the sky was applied, holding the area for the tree in reserve. The bristle brush appears to have been used in places with a zig-zag motion over the surface. The reserve provided for a narrower trunk and a smaller crown.\nA pentiment can be observed in the positioning of the head of the cleric in the foreground. The IRR reveals that he originally did not raise his head - like the other figures/soldiers in the foreground and a deviating first painted version is visible to the naked eye.\nFurthermore the infrared reflectogram shows that the contours of the arms and legs of Hercules, on the right in the foreground, were corrected and made slimmer with the adjoining paint of the landscape after the flesh paint was applied (see left arm, right calf, left foot)."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"new frame\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2014]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["03_IRR/AT_KHM_GG6080_FR-none_2013_05_27_IRR.tif"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Kunsthistorisches Museum, Wien","role":"photographed by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"27.05.2013","endDate":"27.05.2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"09.
