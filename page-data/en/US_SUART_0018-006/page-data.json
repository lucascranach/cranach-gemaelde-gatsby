The head is placed on a table or low wall that cuts the lower portion of the painting. Judith wears a wide brim hat, netting over her hair, a jeweled neck collar and fur over-garment. A tight-waisted gown with full-length sleeves and a braided wrap across her chest complete her costume. The handle of the sword is decorated and Judith's fingers are laden with rings.\n[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 83.5 x 54.6 cm (32 7/8 x 21 1/2 in)\n[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3589,"height":5386}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":300},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none/01_Overall/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none_2015-01_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":600},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none/01_Overall/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none_2015-01_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":900},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none/01_Overall/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none_2015-01_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3589,"height":5386},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none/01_Overall/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none_2015-01_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none/01_Overall/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none_2015-01_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_SUART_0018-006","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > states > New York > counties > Kings > inhabited places > New York","term":"New York","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > states > New York > counties > Kings > inhabited places > New York","term":"New York","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 83.5 x 54.6 cm (32 7/8 x 21 1/2 in)\n[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1525","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"US_SUART_0018-006","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none/01_Overall/US_SUART_0018-006_FR-none_2015-01_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Judith with the Head of Holofernes"},"objectId":826160,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Syracuse University Art Galleries, New York","provenance":"- Leopold von Ranke\n- Mr. and Mrs. John Reid \n[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Syracuse University Art Galleries, New York","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"- examination carried out by West Lake Conservators, Skaneateles, NY\nSusan Blakney, Fellow A.I.C., Fellow I.C.C.\n- report in owner's files \n\n[Syracuse University Art Galleries, revised 2015]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"1977","endDate":"1977"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"04.
