In contrast to earlier late gothic representations the three protagonists are shown as half length figures and are positioned close to the picture plane. The artist has rendered the richness of their clothing, the jewelry as well as their physiognomies with great attention to detail. Lot, the old man with a grey beard has lowered his head and already appears drowsy from the wine given to him by his daughters. In the background a rocky outcrop is visible and at the right are the flames of the burning city of Sodom and the white pillar of salt representing Lot’s wife.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 49.5 x 74 cm\n[Hampel online database:https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-J-1515-1586-zug-Werkstatt-des.html?a=84&s=234&id=90624] (accessed 25.09.2019)","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2303,"height":1515}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":132},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none_2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":263},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none_2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":395},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none_2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2303,"height":1515},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none_2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none_2014_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- along the top edge, in white, the date: '.1.5.44.' and a verse from the bible: 'DINE XVIIII-CA'\n[Hampel online database: https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-J-1515-1586-zug-Werkstatt-des.html?a=84&s=234&id=90624] (accessed 25.09.2019)","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P300","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Veit Thiem","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Veit Thiem","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Dorotheum online database: https://www.dorotheum.com/de/l/6718086/; accessed 31.08.2020]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-J-1515-1586-zug-Werkstatt-des.html?a=84&s=234&id=90624] (accessed 25.09.2019)","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":6,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"20688","details":[{"name":"Veit Thiem","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]},{"constituentId":"113291","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Hampel online database: https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-J-1515-1586-zug-Werkstatt-des.html?a=84&s=234&id=90624] (accessed 25.09.2019)","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 49.5 x 74 cm\n[Hampel online database:https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-J-1515-1586-zug-Werkstatt-des.html?a=84&s=234&id=90624] (accessed 25.09.2019)"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1544","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P300","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P300_FR-none_2014_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Lot and his Daughters"},"objectId":964909,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- Hampel sale, Munich 23.03.2011, lot. 148\n[cda 2019]\n- sold at Dorotheum, Vienna, 09.06.2020, lot 5\n[Dorotheum online database: https://www.dorotheum.com/de/l/6718086/; accessed 31.08.2020]\n- priivate collection\n[cda 2020]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"- two vertical cradle members on the reverse\n[Hampel online database: https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-J-1515-1586-zug-Werkstatt-des.html?a=84&s=234&id=90624] (accessed 25.09.2019)","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2011","endDate":"2011"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"25.
