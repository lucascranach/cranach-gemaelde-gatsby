She is wearing a black dress with white sleeves. Numerous brocade bands are tied around the voluminous material to divide it into segments. She has two chokers, a chain and a large amulet with the linked letters MK around her neck. Her hair is covered with a gold and silver checked hairnet visible under the broad brimmed hat. It has a brocade patterning and small charms (an anchor, an hourglass, a mug, a ship, a book(?), a horn) dangle from its rim.\n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 54 x 38.5 x 1 cm \n[Cat.
