The wooden construction, which is 1.20 m in height, is mounted on a solid projecting stone at a height of c. 2.20 m. The left side of the pulpit with the entrance is shaped like a semi-circle whereas the right side with the lectern is rectangular. \nThe pulpit is decorated with six illustrations of the Life of the Virgin as well as the Life and Passion of Christ. Each scene is separated by a carved pilaster showing Hermes. \nAbove the paintings there is a carved frieze, 34 cm in height, depicting putti in tunics recalling Roman legionary uniforms alternating with different coats-of-arms. In the background green tendrils with predominantly red fruit have been painted behind the carving. There is a wooden base of 14 cm in height with a carved geometric decoration beneath the paintings, which finishes with a profiled batten. Above the pulpit is an abat-voix, which is decorated on the underside with a depiction of the Trinity on a gilded ground. This depiction is surrounded by angels on a blue background, holding the instruments of martyrdom. The painting is framed by a carved egg and dart ornamentation. The top of the abat-voix is decorated with a crown.\nThe six pulpit paintings illustrate - from left to right - the following subjects:\nThe Annunciation, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Baptism of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection. The lectern is located above the Crucifixion. \n \n[Herrschaft 2013, 18-19]","year":2013},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Iconography:\nAlthough not described in the gospels early christian art already attempted to clarify the symbolic character of the event. The subject was frequently represented in paintings from Cranach's workshop, however rarely as an independent motif. It is shown as a component of the 'Law and Grace' paintings. On the epitaph of the Augustusburg altarpiece the resurrection is depicted in  the background. Occasionally it is the central motif of an epitaph, for example the painting dated 1554 in the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig or the Löbnitz Epitaph (1562, Staatliche Galerie Moritzburg). \nThe rising sun in the background of the Augustusburg panel can be interpreted as a metaphor for the resurrection of Christ.[1] Such metaphors employing light play significant role within protestant pictorial art and are characteristic of Cranach the Younger's work.[2] \n[Herrschaft 2013, 30 – 31]\n\n\n\n\n[1] SCHULZE 2004, p. 156.\n[2] SCHULZE 2004, p. 149 – 168.","year":2013}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1573,"dated":"1573","end":1573,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Crucifixion dated]"},"description":"Christ stands on the sealed coffin, wearing only a white loincloth and a red coat.

During the underdrawing process no clarification from a rough design to a more detailed final underdrawing is apparent.

On all the panels the paint layers extend to the edge at the sides - like the ground - whereas the paint layers at the top and bottom end before the ground. \nBy and large all the panels exhibit a very economic painting technique with a thin application of paint, which nevertheless is predominantly opaque. In addition there are areas of glazed colour, where the imprimatura is occasionally visible and influences the colour scheme of the panel. \nThe quality of the painting is very mixed and reveals the cooperation of more than one person on each panel. Many of the affectionately executed details are only visible close up, which considering the position of the panels 2 meters above is never possible. Other areas are less precise and occasionally unfinished (this is also the case for the decorative painting on the pulpit).\n \nThe painting technique of the sixth panel conforms with that of the other paintings, it is not as subtly nuanced as the Nativity and Baptism scenes, but is very similar to the crucifixion scene. \nJesus' red coat has the same opaque application of paint as the vermilion paint on the other paintings. The folds were also modelled employing dark glazes, which are brown to opaque black. The hem of the coat was finished with a delicate double white line and floral ornamentation. In addition delicate gold lines were applied over the white paint. \nThe victory banner exhibits dynamic brushstrokes in grey paint applied in a double row. An application of red lake was employed for the background of the banner. Its original luminosity is only preserved at the top edge of the painting. The cross on the banner is almost colourless with the exception of some bluish admixtures in the grey shadows. It is possible that blue organic dyes like indigo or waid were used. \nThe flesh paint of Christ's corpse corresponds with that of the thieves in the Crucifixion scene. Initially executed in brown, the shadows were modelled in grey and finally a flesh tone was applied in the lighter areas. The painting technique employed for his face is similar to that of St John in the Crucifixion and Entombment scenes with a thickly applied flesh tone over grey shadows on a brown base tone. The cheeks are slightly red. The eyes have black pupils with short black strokes to indicate the eyelids. In contrast the soldiers' faces were executed in a different manner. Dark brown contours were applied to indicate eyes and noses over a brown base tone. Similar to those of the mourning women in the entombment scene - however applied more as a scumble on the soldiers' faces - the faces were covered with grey paint. This flat application was employed in some faces for the highlights only. Beneath this some red is visible on the cheeks. Pure white was only used for the eyeballs. Hair on the heads and beards was - as always - painted with an initial base tone on which the hair was modelled with delicate lines in lighter and darker paint. \nTo create the metallic appearance of the soldiers' armour black contour lines delineating the various segments were painted on a grey ground and highlights were then added in thick white paint. The chainmail was also initially painted in grey and the links were then added employing short curved strokes of light grey and black paint. \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 60-62]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["10_Analysis/DE_SKAU_NONE-SKAU002F_2013-05_Analysis-report.pdf"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Jana Herrschaft","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"05. 2013","endDate":"05. 2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"05.
