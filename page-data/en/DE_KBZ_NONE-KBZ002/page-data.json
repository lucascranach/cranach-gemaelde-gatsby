The canvas has been cropped by c. 4 to 8 cm. The marouflaged canvas support is in a stable condition, but has lost the original function and characteristics of a canvas. Before treatment in 1956 the canvas exhibited extensive deformations, numerous branched tears as well as large losses, particularly in the region of the portraits. Folds in the free-hanging canvas have caused extensive paint loss. The canvas was attached to the hardboard with the tears in this position. The numerous losses have been filled with inserts that are just glued to the auxiliary support but are not attached to the original canvas. The inserts exhibit the same texture as the original, but many do not fit exactly, creating gaps between the insert and the original canvas. These gaps have in part been filled with the wax-resin adhesive or reveal the hardboard. In some cases the thread direction is incorrect e. g. in the left sitter's face an insert was attached with the thread running diagonally. At the edge of the painting the open seam was just stuck down. \n\nGround / Paint layers:\n- Dirt: \nDue to the painting's general dirtily appearance the painting seems rather matt. It is particularly dirty at the centre. There are dark brown, matt (probably) soot- or foxing patches, drips of adhesive at the right, and drips of varnish near the pot. A chalked mark is visible on the curtain. There are traces of retouching paint on the cross and the donor's robe (flesh paint /green, red).\n\n- Damages: \nThe depiction of 'The Eucharist' exhibits an extensive fine network of cracks, with cupping in the areas of the cross, the book, the background and the tablecloth. There are many small losses that go down to the original ground and also include the original paint. No flaking was observed. The paint layers are impregnated with the wax-resin adhesive and appear to be in a stable condition. \n \nOriginal Paint Layers: \nThe original paint layers - with the exception of the donor and cleaned areas - are obscured by overpaint. It is not known to what extent the original paint has been preserved beneath the reworking. Intact as well as very damaged areas of original paint can be observed where there are losses in the upper paint layers. The original paint layers are only preserved in fragments where they have been uncovered. Coherent painted zones exist in the red, green, yellow and white paint like for example God the Father's coat, the wings of the angel and the dove. Whereas where uncovered the paint layers of the sky as well as the flesh paint of the angel, Christ and God the Father reveal only a few small coherent painted sections. \n\nIn the uncovered sections at the top of the painting it is difficult to assess the extent and the position of the original paint layers. The heads and the background were reconstructed over the fragmentary remnants of original paint, probably overpainting original. The crown, the dove and the half visible angel as well as the aureole framing God the Father and the blue sky around the angel require little retouching.\n\nAbraded areas with exposed canvas are visible in losses, in the uncovered sections as well as in the donors. Glazes and gilding have almost completely disappeared (during the cleaning and maroflaging). The donors were not overpainted. There are some older retouches. The tears and losses have caused large paint losses in the faces. Joachim's eyes and Wolfgang's beard are particularly affected. Remnants of overpaint are visible in the uncovered areas (green of robe - grey remnants/ red robe - green and grey remnants) \n[Condition Report, Silke Hönig, Nov. 2014]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"11. 2014","endDate":"11. 2014"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"26.

The painting was very dirty and exhibited extensive deformations. The faces of the dukes were compromised by large losses in the canvas and the paint layers. The painting was examined and a conservation treatment was carried out. Surface dirt was removed from the painting. The lining and painted areas in the corners was removed. Due to the extensive damage it was decides to maroflage the painting onto a hardboard auxiliary support. The adhesive chosen for both this transfer and the consolidation of the paint layers was a wax-resin mixture (wax + rosin + venetian turpentine).Where larger areas of canvas were missing inserts with similar surface textures were fixed in place. \nX-radiography was employed to establish what was depicted beneath the overpaint. The results suggested that the underlying paint layers were in good condition and lead to the decision to remove the overpaint. This was begun at the left side, then tests were done at the bottom and finally the overpaint was removed from the upper section. Various solvents were tested and diluted acetic acid was selected as most suitable. In the lower and upper sections the solvent was used to soften the layers of overpaint and then it was removed with a scalpel under the microscope. From the beginning the removal prompted a very controversial discussion. The removal was then abandoned in 1965 because of the fragmentary state of the original paint. The upper section was then reconstructed (a wax/chalk ground over losses, watercolours, two coats of Mastic/turpentine 1:3, mussini-oil paints), however the original sections in this area are still difficult to decipher. \n[Examination Report, Silke Hönig, Nov. 2014]","signature":{"date":"30.

This caused an overhang of c. 1 to 2 cm. \n- at the top edge the missing section was reconstructed with material from the removed panel: the sections were butt-joined and a wooden veneer (2 cm thick) was adhered to the reverse (with PVAC glue (Ponal)) as carpenters glue would not have provided the required stability considering the relatively small area of adhesion. \n- the canvas was attached by reactivating (with heat/iron) what wax-resin adhesive was left, and where necessary new wax was added. \n- an 8 mm plywood board was fitted in the new frame to provide addition support for the painting. It was then fixed in the frame with wooden battens that were screwed into the frame. The rebate was lined with polyester felt to cushion the contact surface. \n\nSurface cleaning: \n- the reverse was surface cleaned with a Hoover \n- surface cleaning of the paint layers (slightly damp cloth/sponge or swab) \n- removal of the dark dirty incrustations in the beige background of 'The Last Supper' was done mechanically with a scalpel, and the area was then cleaned with slightly damp swab. \n- mechanical removal (scalpel) of a glossy varnish drip as well as crusty spots and displaced paint flakes (from the maroflage) \n- removal of partial incrustations of dirt on the green curtain: repeatedly softened with a moisture treatment and then removed in discrete layers with drying periods in between  \nAfter the surface cleaning a whitish film was evident in some areas and was probably caused by remnants of a surface coating or varnish that has begun to degrade. \n- regeneration of these areas by rolling an acetone swab over them once\nRemoval of the remnants of overpaint from the uncovered lower section of God the Father's coat\n- softened with acetic acid (25%ig) (following the method recorded in the examination report from 1959 to 1965), subsequently mechanically removed with a scalpel, repeated treatment of an area with drying periods in between; in some sections DMSO achieved the same degree of softness \nThe removal was very laborious and time consuming, particularly in areas where the original paint layers beneath the overpaint are very damaged. Here, because the original was so damage the adhesion of the overpaint to the support is much greater. \nThe dark green final glaze belonging to the overpaint was removed first and then the compact grey layer. \n\nRestoration Treatment: \nFilling of losses in the paint layers \nOnly the large, obtrusive losses around the tears and holes were to be filled. In the sections where inserts were already present the fill material was to be applied like a ground, exploiting the canvas beneath to achieve the desired surface texture. \n- first the two inserts with incorrect thread counts were replaced \n- the losses were sized with rabbit skin glue (70:1000)\n- deeper losses were filled with a chalk paste (champagne chalk/animal skin glue 70:1000, pigmented slightly with yellow) \n- the shallow losses were filled with a liquid chalk ground (champagne chalk/animal skin glue 70:1000, pigmented slightly with yellow) \n- finally the surface was wet sanded flush with the surrounding area \n- an isolating layer of shellac was applied to the fills \n\nRetouching: \nConcept: \nThe extent and the type of retouching as well as the use of different media were decided in situ on the 28.04.2015 together with Fr. Dr. Danz and Herrn Pfarrer Lindemann (representing the owner). The retouches were generally to be glazed, and in the area of the curtain an aqua-sporca method was to be employed. It thus remains possible to recognize the fragmentary and damaged state of the painting, while achieving the optical reintegration of isolated areas. Losses in the overpainted sections of the curtain where original paint is visible were not to be retouched. \nMethod and execution: \n- 'The Eucharist' (Overpaint, Beck 1853): water colours, in the pale background, mixed with white tempera paint to achieve the pale tones \n- green curtain: lean Mussini-oil/resin paint with oil of turpentine as diluent, gloss adjusted with dammar in turpentine (1:8)\n- the figures of Wolfgang and Joachim (preserved original paint): application of a thin dammar varnish (1:8) to saturate the predominantly dark area; retouched with Mussini-oil/resin paints using turpentine as a diluent \n- the uncovered original sections (red coat, background): lean Mussini- oil/resin paint using turpentine as a diluent; the gloss was adjusted with dammar in turpentine (1:8) \nOnce the painting was framed it became apparent that a strip of the backboard (c. max. 2 cm in width) was exposed at the left and right sides where the rounded top begins. This area was also retouched with lean Mussini-oil/resin using turpentine as a diluent. \nConclusion: \nAn optical reintegration of the disfiguring sections was achieved. However as already suggested by Frau S. Hönig in her Conservation concept it would be helpful for the viewer (particularly for the final display situation in the St. Bartholomäi-Kirche) if a explanatory text were available. The painting has a documentary character and exemplary historical validity due to its present condition.\n\nNew insight with regards the history of the object: \n[...]\nThe overpaint on the Holy Trinity:  \nIn the second half of this chapter written sources are listed that indirectly suggest a change in the painting's appearance:\n1. 1596 - the painting of the Holy Trinity was eliminated and replaced by a cloud \n2. 1662 - the baptism of Christ should be removed or concealed \n3. 1699 - the sarcophagus painting was touched up and recorded in the town chronicle of 1758-1823 as being among the paintings located there \n\nThe period between 1596 and 1699 can be considered as the possible time span in which the Holy Trinity was overpainted. However the ageing and condition of the paint layers as well as the observations made during the removal of areas of overpaint do not allow a more precise dating, as no significant changes occurred in painting techniques during that period. The degree of ageing is typical for both the 16th and 17th centuries. It can however be excluded that a cloud was painted beneath the overpainted curtain. Removal of remnants of overpaint at the right beside the figure of Wolfgang began with a final dark green glaze. The layer beneath this revealed an arrangement of folds executed in white and grey. This undermodelling would have been completed with the application of the afore mentioned glaze and would have shimmered through (as can be observed in other areas of the painting). It is a very compact layer and was applied directly over the original paint surface. \n\nThe overpaint on the Eucharist: \nIt is certain that the painting was reworked in 1853 by the court painter Beck. The depiction of 'The Eucharist' attributed to him was executed on a pale, relatively thick isolating ground that was applied to the area between the two sides of the curtain and the donor figures before it was reworked. The paint application here is quite different from the rest of the picture; the surface appears more matt and was probably executed employing a certain amount of tempera medium (during the surfacing cleaning it appeared sensitive to moisture). Along cracks and in areas where the paint layers have separated the underlying dark curtain is visible. Cleaned areas mentioned by Beck were not found, but are (if they were present) covered by the ground layer. My observations here correspond with those of Frau Hönig. \n\nObservations concerning the cleaned area at the bottom: \nDark shadows could be discerned in the exposed zone along the lower edge beneath 'The Eucharist' by Beck after surface cleaning. These could not be reconciled with the representation of Christ's foot now visible. They may represent shadows caused by the binding medium of another paint layer. However this phenomenon cannot be determined with absolute certainty. \n[Conservation Treatment Report, Grit Jehmlich Juni 2014]","signature":{"date":"27.

Both formats were used by Lucas Cranach the Younger. The lower edge exhibits only minimal deformations that stem from the last re-stretching. The striking bust representation of the donor is quite the contrary of Cranach the Younger’s usual full-length depiction of donors and suggests that the format was considerably cropped.
