She is wearing contemporary courtly attire, consisting of a red velvet dress with puffed white sleeves and a fur-trimmed cloak, embroidered with elaborate brocade decoration. Her hair is pinned up and covered with a soft velvet fur-lined hat. Her outfit is completed with a large-linked gold chain and a necklace set with precious stones.
