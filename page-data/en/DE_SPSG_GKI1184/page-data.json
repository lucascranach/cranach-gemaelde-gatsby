The tree, which is split down the centre, indicates that they belong together and were originally displayed next to each other. […]\nInspired by Dürer’s famous engraving (1504) and his paintings (1507) Cranach and his workshop have depicted Adam and Eve in more than 50 versions, either on two separate panels or together on one, in different sizes and poses as well as against different backgrounds. The function of these paintings has not yet been completely clarified and probably varied. They may have been used as wing panels, but are also associated with the ‚Weiberlisten‘ and warn against female seduction and a disregard of God’s commandments. As the paintings in Berlin were executed in 1537 together with the Passion cycle they may also like it have been intended for the collegial church (Stiftskirche); however as yet no evidence confirming their use as wing panels could be found. Therefore it is conceivable that they were displayed as an ‘Exempla of Virtue’ in a corresponding decorative scheme in a room of the Berlin palace.'\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.

Her body is turned frontally to the viewer and although her head is turned slightly to the left she looks directly at the viewer. Eve wears her long blond hair loose. In her left hand, which is raised, she holds an apple from which she has already taken a bite. In her right hand, which is also raised, she holds onto the branch of a tree around which the serpent has wound itself. The trunk of the tree extends along the left side of the painting.  Eve stands on stony ground in front of dark green undergrowth, which is in contrast to the light flesh paint. A stag lies behind her and also looks out at the viewer.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 175 x 66 cm\n[Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten, Berlin - Brandenburg, revised 2011]","exhibitionHistory":"Berlin 1937, no. 101\nBerlin 2009/10, no.
