The child wears a transparent shirt witha gold border. He supports a tau cross with his left hand. The base of the cross touches the ground and it is inscribed with the initials 'INRI' and decorated with a crown of thorns. The child's head is circumscribed by golden rays; his right hand is raised in an attitude of blessing. \n\nVerso: in contrast to the full-length figure on the recto the veso shows a close-up image of the Man of Sorrows. He holds rods and a whip in his crossed hands. His body is covered with blood and exhibits wounds on his hands and in his side. His head is crowned with thorns and he has a halo. \n\n[Görres, cda 2014]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 53.1 x 30.3 cm \n[Cat.
