During treatment by Lily Lange-Bellstedt in 1962 the painting on parchment was removed from the panel.\nAfterwards the reverse was presumably sanded down (open worm channels). The panel was impregnated with a mixture of ethanol, ethylene glycol and shellac, presumably to straighten it. A missing corner on the top right was reconstructed using plywood. Probably glue/chalk fills, retouches in water-colour and tempera (?), mastix varnish.\n\nIn 1975 the panel was treated again by Christiane Rohland. A slight convex warp was observed in the panel, which increased after the two battens attached to the frame were removed. The panel had evidently been subjected to undue stress by this framing system. \nConsolidation of tenting at the bottom right with bees wax, varnish application with dammar to matt retouches, some synthetic resin retouches (AW2).\n\nIn 1979 the panel was again removed from its frame by Mrs Rohland to record a comparative curve. The warp had increased.\n\nTo reframe the panel pieces of cork were nailed into the rebate. Only the central section of the top and bottom of the rebate was padded. The backboard consisted of a press board, the rough side of which had been painted black and consituted the reverse of the frame.\n\n[Bettina Landgrebe, condition report for loan request, Städelsche Kunstinstitute, Frankfurt, 7.2.2007, in the files of the Kunsthalle Bremen]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2007","endDate":"2007"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"06.
