The painting described exhibits the same composition as the present painting, showing Christ with his arm stretched down to the left, while he turns towards the woman bending down on his right. Whereas the Christ figure depicted in the other type bends his right arm to the right and touches a second child with his hand. The woman at the right in the foreground shown from the reverse belongs to this second type. Kunsthalle Hamburg (Koller-Auction May 1977, No. 5079).\n[Maria Winner/Sarah Klein, Augsburg, 21.
