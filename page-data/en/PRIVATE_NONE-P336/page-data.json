Legend has it that once while saying Mass, Gregory became aware of a congregation member who doubted the Transsubstantiation (when the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ). As he prayed for a sign to convince the doubter, Gregory beheld a vision of Christ as the Man of Sorrows surrounded by the instruments of his Passion rising from the altar.  \nThe Mass of Saint Gregory became a popular subject among artists during the Reformation because it illustrated the validity of the Doctrine of the Transsubstantiation. The artist of this painting has imbued his interpretation of the tale with a curious dynamism, depicting characters and objects from the biblical narrative of the last days of Christ within a billowing cloud. Next to the figure of Christ crowned with thorns float the disembodied heads of Pontius Pilate with his wife, Caiaphas, and Judas as well as the cock that crowed thrice, the tools of his crucifixion, and angels.\nThe panel is charged below with the coats-of-arms of the Venediger and Remees families.\n[Sotheby's online database:
