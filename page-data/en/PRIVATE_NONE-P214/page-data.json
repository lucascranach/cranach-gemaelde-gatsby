In this painting Judith is shown wearing a sumptuous dress, standing in front of a black background behind a balustrade, on which she rests the severed head she is holding. In her right hand Judith presents the sword with which she commited the act. She also wears a broad-brimmed hat over an embroidered snood and has a collar and a large linked chain around her neck. \n[Daniel Görres, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: unknown\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 231]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1361,"height":2025}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":595},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":893},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1361,"height":2025},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":595},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":893},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1361,"height":2025},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P214","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 231]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 231]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: unknown\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, no. 231]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1530","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P214","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P214_FR231_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Judith"},"objectId":931754,"objectName":"FR231","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- Paris, auction of the collection of Mme.
