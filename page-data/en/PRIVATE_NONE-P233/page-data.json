According to the previous owner Prof. Dr. Ernst Buchner was the first to attribute the painting to Lucas Cranach, dating it to about 1518 on the 12. Oktober 1954, Munich. The Cranach expert Dr. Dieter Koepplin, Basel, ascribed the painting to the ‚Master of the Pflock Altarpiece‘, an apprentice to Cranach, in his essay in the Kunstchronik, Bd. XXV, Munich 1972. In a letter from Prof. Dr. Dieter Koepplin, Basel, he refers to the painting as probably by the ‚Master of the Pflock Altarpiece‘, about 1520/25 (Letter from 21.03.2010). Ludwig Meyer, Archiv für Kunstgeschichte Munich is of the same opinion as is Prof. Dr. Ingo Sandner, in his letter from 27.03.2010. Prof. Dr. Dieter Koepplin provided useful information regarding the context of the original commission: \"... the subject of the death of the Virgin is not one associated with Luther the order must therefore have come from a dioceses (like Naumburg, Merseburg, Meissen etc.) or the dominion of the Duke of Saxony, where for example Annaberg was located, a place associated with the Master of the Pflock Altarpiece. His name is derived from an altarpiece produced for the Pflock family chapel in St Anne’s church, Annaberg-Buchholz. The anonymous Cranach apprentice created the altarpiece in 1521 for the donor Lorenz Pflock, who was the owner of the silver mines in the region and a councilman in Annaberg. The death of the Virgin is also depicted on this altarpiece in the central shrine. Ludwig Meyer dates the present work to the period between 1518 and 1523. \n\n[Hampel online database, accessed 14.10.2019](https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-Ae-1472-Kronach.html?a=87&s=243&id=94894)","year":2011}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1518,"dated":"about 1520","end":1525,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1517","end":"1520","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 91, no. 106C]","text":"about 1518"},{"begin":"1518","end":"1530","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Koepplin, letter from 21.03.2010][Sandner, letter from 27.03.2010] see: [Hampel online database, accessed 03.03.2021](https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-Ae-1472-Kronach.html?a=87&s=243&id=94894)","text":"about 1520 - 1525"}],"remarks":"[Lempertz online database, accessed 15.11.2018](https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/1097-1/2008-meister-des-pflockschen-altars.html)"},"description":"The large format panel painting was originally conceived for an altarpiece and the upper half exhibits decorative gilding. The painter positioned the Virgin's bed in the lower left half of the image. Her head is supported by three pillows and her face is idealized, showing youthful features. A very fine almost invisible veil covers her golden brown hair. The apostles are gathered around the Virgin. St John the Evangelist offers a candle, which the Virgin accepts with both hands, while he guides her. James the Greater is depicted behind, and can be identified by his pilgrim's hat and the scallop shell. St Peter stands with is back to the viewer, wearing a gold coloured brocade gown and holds up an incense burner.\n[Lempertz online database, accessed 15.11.2018](https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/1097-1/2008-meister-des-pflockschen-altars.html)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 158 x 116 cm\n[Lempertz online database, accessed 15.11.2018](https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/1097-1/2008-meister-des-pflockschen-altars.html)\nDifferent measurements cited by Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979: 181 x 138 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 91, No. 106C]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3744,"height":5068}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":273},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":546},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":819},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4851,"height":6622},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":271},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":541},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":812},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3744,"height":5068},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P233_FR106C_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- on the neckband of the dress:\n'MARIA + MATE[R DEI]\" (Mary, Mother of God) \n[Lempertz online database, accessed 15.11.2018](https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/1097-1/2008-meister-des-pflockschen-altars.html)","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P233","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Master of the Pflock Altarpiece","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Master of the Pflock Altarpiece","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Lempertz online database, accessed 15.11.2018](https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/1097-1/2008-meister-des-pflockschen-altars.html)\n[Koepplin 1972, 346]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Burkhard 1936, 90, No. 413]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Follower of Lucas Cranach the Elder"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":6,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Hampel online database, accessed 03.03.2021](https://www.hampel-auctions.com/a/Lucas-Cranach-d-Ae-1472-Kronach.html?a=87&s=243&id=94894)","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":8,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, no. 93b]\n[Prof. Dr. Ernst Buchner, expertise 12.
