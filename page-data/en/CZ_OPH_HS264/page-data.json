Only the figure of Christ is slightly reminiscent of his work; the other figures are of another style. The wicked, mocking faces of Christ’s tormentors are derived from the figures of coarse rustics and the dregs of society depicted in various moralistic works by Nederlandish painters, from Quinten Massys to Jan Hemessen and Jan Massys. The way in which the soldiers humiliate and torture Christ goes considerably beyond how this scene is described in all four of the Gospels. Although the painting is not the work an exceptional artist, it is still interesting for its untraditional approach to a traditional theme.'\n\n[Cat.
