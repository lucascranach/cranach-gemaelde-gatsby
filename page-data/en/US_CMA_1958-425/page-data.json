The Elector of Saxony John Frederick the Magnanimous, shown in the bottom left corner, is depicted in dark green hunting attire; he spans his crossbow and waits for a stag to cross the river. On the opposite side stands his wife, the Electress Sibylle, poised to take the first ceremonial shot. By spreading various running animals and armed noblemen across the surface, the artist executed an extremely complex composition. The prince electors of Saxony were passionate practitioners of parforce hunting with dogs - elaborate, highly rehearsed occasions, coordinated by the use of signals from hunting horns. The green areas and the wavy river increase the rhythm in the painting. Lucas Cranach the Elder dated this work and signed it with an insignia of a winged snake at the lower right (on the boat). The 1577 in the right-hand corner is the house of Saxony's inventory number.\n[The Cleveland Museum of Art, revised 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 116.80 x 170.20 cm (45 15/16 x 67

The varnish is significantly discolored yellow, distorting the overall tonality of the composition.  Additionally, it is marred by drips and splatters and is coated with a matte surface accumulation.\n\nSUPPORT\nConstruction: The paint and ground layers have been transferred to a new panel support consisting of a 1/2\" thick honeycomb core veneered with a 1/8\" thick layer of pressed wood toward the face and 1/8\" thick layer of mahogany on the reverse. The ground has been adhered to the pressed wood veneer with rabbit skin glue. The reverse side was sealed with varnish and wax. A cradle consisting of nine horizontal glued members and twelve vertical sliding members is attached to the reverse. This transfer treatment was carried out in 1959 by William Suhr. A radiograph of the lower right corner of the painting reveals the honeycomb support structure.\n\nA record photograph of a detail of the reverse of the orginal wood panel taken before the transfer confirms the insect damaged condition of the wood. It appears to have been either beech or linden or walnut. Several knots were present and the original chisel marks were evident.\n\nCondition:  The support is in stable condition and completely planar.\n\nPAINT/GROUND LAYERS\nConstruction:  There is a white ground layer estimated to be chalk.  Because of the transfer and the loss of the extreme margins, there are no details about its application to describe. The 1959 treatment notes also state that the ground layer was thinned during the transfer process.\nSome fine black line preliminary drawing is detectable under the figures and architecture when viewed with infrared reflectography.\nGlazes in oil paint were laid in to form the undertone for the landscape.  A light yellowish brown toning is evident, followed by glazes of darker brown and green for the terrain and grey wash for the water.  Locally-applied opaque touches of color define the details of foliage and other vegetation.  The figures appear to have been painted over the completed landscape including the blades of grass.  The weapons and the antlers of the stags, in particular, clearly overlap the grass blades.\n\nCondition:  The ground layer is in stable condition.  The paint layers are also secure, although there are areas of horizontal tenting in the upper center and upper right regions.  These deformities appear to be consolidated by the adhesive used in the transfer.\nThere is a network of cracquelure with related low cupping throughout the paint.  The degree of cupping has been minimized by the transfer treatment, but is still prominent in the upper right corner.  The paint is in generally very good condition, with some minor abrasion in some of the thinly-painted passages, such as the grey washes in the water.  Losses are comparatively minimal for a panel painting of this size.  Most of the paint loss is concentrated along the edges of the composition.  A larger area of margin loss occurs along the middle right near the grouping of figures.  These have been restored.  Other significant restored paint losses are at H.49 W.19 cm from the lower right: H.75 W.53 cm from the lower right.\n\nVARNISH\nAn older natural resin varnish was removed and replaced with dammar in 1998. Retouches were carried out using PVA medium.\n[Marcia Steele, The Cleveland Museum of Art, 2017]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2017","endDate":"2017"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"22.
