A town with church towers in the mid-distance, mountains beyond, upper left; another walled town, with tall-chancelled church, on a hill, upper right. Across the meadow, from right to left, several men on horseback, accompanied by dogs, pursue numerous stags (one has been trapped by encircling dogs). Other stags, pursued by dogs, swim across the river. On the river bank, concealed by trees and bushes, are several men with crossbows, which they aim at the stags; some also accompanied by servants and dogs. In the river, left of centre, a long wooden boat, directed by a puntsman; two richly-dressed couples stand in the centre; two more couples sit, one forward, one aft. Centre right, mid-distance, a troop of armoured men on horseback.\n[http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=87529](accessed 22.10.2014)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 83.2 x 119.5 cm (estimate)\n[Burrell Collection, revised 2015]","exhibitionHistory":"London 1924, No. 100\nLondon 1950/1, No. 12\nManchester 1961, No. 85\nLondon 1975, No. 8","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3508,"height":2353}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":134},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none_2009_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":268},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none_2009_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":402},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none_2009_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3508,"height":2353},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none_2009_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none_2009_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"UK_BC_35-73","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2016]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Copy after Lucas Cranach the Elder (?)"},{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Burrell Collection, revised 2015]","role":"Artist","suffix":"and workshop"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United Kingdom > countries > Scotland > unitary authorities > Glasgow","term":"Glasgow","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Burrell collection, revised 2015]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 83.2 x 119.5 cm (estimate)\n[Burrell Collection, revised 2015]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1600","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"UK_BC_35-73","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BC_35-73_FR-none_2009_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Stag Hunt"},"objectId":829925,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Culture and Sport Glasgow (Museums)","provenance":"- Lawrie & Co., Glasgow, 1899-1905\n- Lawrie sale, Christie's, London, 28 January 1905\n- Sir William Burrell (1861-1958), 8 Great Western Terrace, Glasgow, by c. 1905.\n- Given by Sir William and Lady Burrell 1944\n[Burrell collection, revised 2015]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"242 - 243","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.
