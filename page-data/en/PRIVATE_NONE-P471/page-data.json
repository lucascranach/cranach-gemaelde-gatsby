The figurative group is represented in front of a rocky outcrop. Christ is positioned at the centre of the composition, and with an expression of reflective sadness he is prepared to accept his fate. Soldiers have already encircled him. The panel depicts the moment when Judas, dressed in yellow, embraces Christ, and identifies him with a kiss. From behind one of the soldiers places a noose around his neck. Christ does not resist. The apostle Peter is shown at the left returning his sword into the sheath, having just cut an ear off Malchus, the servant of the High Priest Caiaphas. In his right hand Christ holds the ear ready to reattach it to the servant, who is crouched on the ground in front of him with his lantern knocked to the ground. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Maße Bildträger: 77,5 x 51,6 cm\n[Auszug aus einem Auktionskatalog, Trafalgar Galleries (2009); Koepplin Archiv]\nDimensions of support: 77.5 x 51.6 cm\n[Cutting from an auction catalogue, Trafalgar Galleries (2009), Koepplin Archive]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1710,"height":2457}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":287},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":575},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":862},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1710,"height":2457},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P471_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P471","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Master of the Pflock Altarpiece","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Master of the Pflock Altarpiece","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[I.
