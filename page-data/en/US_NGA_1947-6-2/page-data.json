The regal costume accord well with that found in other of Cranach's portraits of Saxon nobility. The crown worn by the boy is a traditional sign of engagement [2]. The girl is probably the boy's sister, as the absence of a garland on her head makes it unlikely that she is his fiancée. The betrothal of noble children was not uncommon; Talbot called attention to Berhard Strigel's portrait of Ludwig of Hungary (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), aged nine and wearing a crown, painted in 1515 on the occasion of a double engagement of Ludwig and his sister to a daughter and son of Philip the Fair [3]. In addition, Cranach's portrait dated 1529 of a young boy wearing a betrothal crown (FR329) is tentatively identified as a prince of Saxony [4]. \nThere have been two attempts to identify the children in the National Gallery portraits. Friedländer and Rosenberg thought they were possibly the children of Duke George the Bearded of Saxony: Prince Friedrich, born in 1504, and Princess Christine, born in 1505 [5]. Werl suggested that they might be Count Philipp of Hesse and duchess Elizabeth of Saxony, but Koepplin, the only author to comment, did not find this proposal convincing [6]. Neither identification can be verified. While it is often difficult to guess the ages of children in portraits, it seems to the author that the girl is several years older than her brother, which argues against the identification put forward by Friedländer and Rosenberg.\nFollowing Friedländer and Rosenberg, most authors agree in dating the portraits to the period around 1516/1518. Ruhmer thought they might be later but declined specific comments, while Werl would like to date them around 1512, primarily because Elizabeth of Saxony was born in 1502 [7].\nAs noted by Talbot, however, there are stylistic comparisons with the pair of portraits of Maurice Buchner, dated 1518, and his wife Anna (US_MIA_57-11_FR127, US_MIA_57-10_FR128), and further, the National Gallery's paintings are not as patterned and as severe as the 'Portrait of a Young Girl' [in Paris] usually dated around 1520 (FR153) [8].'\n \n[1] [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, Nos. 104, 105]\n[2] Compare, for example, Cranach's portraits of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous and Sibyl of Cleve, both dated 1526 (DE_KSW_G11_FR304, DE_KSW_G12_FR305). Both persons wear crowns; the betrothal took place in September 1526 and the wedding in June of the following year.

In the expressions of the boy and girl the artist has captured the wistful innocence and gentle seriousness of childhood. Depicted in half length against a black background, the pair are regally dressed. [...] The girl's costume is equally splendid. Her dress is a heavy red fabric, perhaps velvet or a dull satin, with a floral pattern in yellow and with slashed and puffed sleeves. At the top of the bodice is a wide piece of cloth-of-gold, and around her shoulders is an elaborate gold chain. A final touch of elegance is provided by the gold necklace edged with delicate white flowers (daisies?) made of enamel.'\n\n[Hand, Cat.

There is a good deal of thin retouching in the face, which because it is among the most thinly applied passages, is also the most abraded. There are some retouched losses along the hairline as well as other scattered loss over the painting. U.V. shows the extent of the retouching adequately. .[..] the additions along the edge are retouched as well as a good deal of frame abrasion at the bottom edge.\nThere is a fine network of cracks running primarily in the vertical direction corresponding to the orientation of the wood grain.\nThe support is in good condition in spite of extensive worm tunneling on the reverse. It appears stable and adequately strong.[...]\nBesides the panel on which the original painting was applied, there are additional borders attached on the left and right edges which are approximately 3/8 inch wide. These are retouched over to match the surrounding paint. The wood in these additions appears to be oak. On the reverse of the panel a cradle has been applied; it consists of five fixed vertical members and four sliding horizontal members. The wood in the cradle also appears to be oak.\nThe varnish is a relatively thick layer of Natural resin. The greenish fluorescence under Ultraviolet light indicates this type of resin. There is an area in the lower right which fluoresces less than the rest of the painting, indicating that some of the varnish was removed in this area.[...]\nThe varnish is milky and has become somewhat opaque, particularly in the background. The effect is to make the background appear absolutely flat.\n\n\n[Examination report, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1989]\nSee also attached pdf [forthcoming]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"31.01.1989","endDate":"31.01.1989"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"17.

The panel is approximately a quarter of an inch thick and has been visibly planed down. Woodworm channels are visible on the back of the panel.\nThe overall appearance of the varnish is a sprayed, cloudy surface with large aperture cracks throughout, and a large glossy area at lower right. Under microscopic examination it appears to be pitted and it is difficult to see through the surface of the painting in some areas. According to the conservation file, the varnish is a natural resin (est.) with a 1962 spray application of Acryloid B-72 applied to the surface.\n\nTreatment Recommendations:\n\n- sampling and analysis\n- remove discoloured and disfiguring varnish and inpainting\n- consolidate loose paint\n- check structural condition of the panel\n- apply isolating varnish, inpaint losses, apply final varnish\n\n\n[Examination Report and Treatment Proposal, National Gallery of Art, Washington 2005]\nSee also attached pdf [forthcoming]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"31.10.2005","endDate":"01.11.2005"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"17.
