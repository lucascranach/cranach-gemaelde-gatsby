He turns to his right toward the posthumous image of Luther (1483 -1546) who is far larger in bulk, and shown facing to his left, wearing an academic gown and holding an open book (the Luther Bible?) with both hands. Both men are shown in half-length, hatless and in three quarter profile against a pale grey-blue wall. A green curtain has been drawn back on either side to reveal a window with a view of the landscape beyond. The composition is of extreme horizontal format. Beneath the figures there is a Latin inscription on the parapet. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 37 x 56.5 cm\n[Cat.
