The most spectacular discovery was made on the Predella of the Magdalene Altarpiece, which also differs stylistically in the painted version from the other panels belonging to this altarpiece. On the left edge of the panel a grotesque caricature can be discerned, further right in the area of the group of three trees is an archer. He aims into the image with his taught bow, behind him is a second figure wearing a helmet. There is a third figure near the bushes with the visor of his helmet. He moves to the right; and if he does as it appears really carry a lance on his shoulder it is decided too long. The foot visible beneath the bushes might belong to this figure. To the right of the bushes a further soldier in armor bends over and his face is strangely foreshortened. The draftsman has practiced drawing the mouth of a fish at the bottom edge of the painting. On the far right a nude female figure (in a boat ?) is visible with all sorts of sea creatures. She turns to the right (towards the archer ?). The figure of Jonah was also changed several times: like in the painted version Jonah is depicted wearing a short robe, but in the drawing a belt or sash is visible, which hangs down. In the drawing his left foot was still within the mouth of the whale.\nThe underdrawing suggests that the Jonah panel was either originally conceived for another subject or that it was used in the workshop for sketches, some humorous, which were never intended to be carried out. The observation that the composition is open and incomplete suggests the latter. The single motifs of soldiers, archers, water and the woman ‚Äì the latter with parodistic elements, there all alone and naked in the boat ‚Äì could be motifs taken from the depiction of the martyrdom of St Ursula and the 11000 virgins. The saint is one of the patrons of the collegial church (Stiftskirche) in Halle and it is therefore possible that a panel depicting this legend was in the church as either a predella or an independent painting. These annotations would accordingly be the last witness to a loss painting. [1] \n[1] One possibility is the predella of the Barbara altarpiece, which was also dedicated to this saint as well as the 11000 virgins; see [Steinmann 1968, 75, 77-80, 87]'\n[Schawe 2007 B, 236, 240]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["03_IRR/DE_BStGS_9783_FRSup009-010_2006-03_IRR.tif","03_IRR/DE_BStGS_9783_FRSup009-010_2006-03_IRR-Detail-001.tif","03_IRR/DE_BStGS_9783_FRSup009-010_2006-03_IRR-Detail-002.tif","03_IRR/DE_BStGS_9783_FRSup009-010_2006-03_IRR-Detail-003.tif","03_IRR/DE_BStGS_9783_FRSup009-010_2006-03_IRR-Detail-004.tif"],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2006","endDate":"2006"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"03.
