Her face, which  expresses sufferance, is tilted to the left and she gazes into the far distance. She holds a long dagger in her right hand with the tip pointing up towards her. In her left hand she holds an overcoat, which is wrapped around her hips and covers her lap. In addition she wears a transparent undergarment and a similarly transparent veil. Her hair is pinned up under the veil. She wears a piece of jewellery in the form of a linked chain with a pendant. The background is dark. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: \n58.2 x 40.2 cm\n[Cat.
