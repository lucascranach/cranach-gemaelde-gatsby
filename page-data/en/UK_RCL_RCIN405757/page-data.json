Paris chose Venus, who rewarded him with the beautiful Helen, wife of the Spartan King Menelaus. Paris's abduction of Helen led to the downfall of Troy. The story told in Dares of Phrygia's sixth-century Bellum Troianum was modified in later accounts, such as the influential Historia destructionis Troiae by Guido delle Colonne in the thirteenth century. In Guido's version, Paris is a knight out hunting who, tying his horse to a tree, fell asleep and dreamed that Mercury presented the three goddesses to him; Paris asked them to put aside their clothes, and when he chose Venus he was released from sleep. Cranach seems to follow this version here; his knight is lost in the forest and has a dazed appearance, as if awakening from a dream.\nCranach has painted Mercury as an old man who hands him a crystal orb which is inscribed 'MONET' ('he (or it) warns or advises' in Latin), perhaps referring to Paris's task of judging the three goddesses in front of him. As in other versions by Cranach, the goddesses are hard to identify, but it is probably Venus who stands closest to Paris, casting a knowing look at the viewer and at whom Cupid aims his arrow.'\n[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?searchText=cranach&x=0&y=0&object=405757&row=4&detail=about] (accessed 23.02.2012)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50.2 x 34.9 cm\n[The Royal Collection, revised 2012]\n\nDimensions including frame: 61.4 x 45.5 cm\n[The Royal Collection, revised 1993]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1868,"height":2898}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":284},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":568},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":852},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1834,"height":2603},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":310},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":621},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":931},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1868,"height":2898},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- on the glass orb:\n'MONET'","inventoryNumber":"UK_RCL_RCIN405757","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[The Royal Collecion, revised 2012]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"Front of the frame:\nLabel: 'LUCAS CRANACH THE JUDGEMENT OF PARIS'\n\n[The Royal Collection, revised 1993]","locations":[{"path":"United Kingdom > countries > England > metropolitan areas > Greater London > inhabited places > London","term":"London","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United Kingdom > countries > England > metropolitan areas > Greater London > inhabited places > London","term":"London","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[The Royal Collection, revised 2012]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 50.2 x 34.9 cm\n[The Royal Collection, revised 2012]\n\nDimensions including frame: 61.4 x 45.5 cm\n[The Royal Collection, revised 1993]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1530 - 1535","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"UK_RCL_RCIN405757","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_RCL_RCIN405757_FR-none_1991-01_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Judgement of Paris"},"objectId":475787,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, London","provenance":"- first recorded in the Royal Collection during the reign of James II\n[The Royal Collection, revised 2012]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"The Royal Collection, London","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"- no information available","processingDates":{"beginDate":"1993","endDate":"1993"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"24.
