She looks coquettishly out of the image, while Cupid looks ruefully up at her holding a honeycomb in his hand. Her jewels and diaphanous veil are characteristic of Cranach, however her physical features do appear somewhat awkward. The ancient subject refers to Theocritus' Idyll. Venus cautions Cupid, who complains that he has been stung by bees, and reminds the viewer that even the briefest lust is associated with bitter pain. This fusion of a morality tale and an erotic appeal made the motif popular at the time and variants were not only produced by Cranach and his workshop. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 170.8 x 69.9 cm\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/lucas-cranach-the-elder-and-workshop-kronach-4892877-details.aspx?; accessed 01.06.2020]","exhibitionHistory":"Rotterdam 1928/1929\nAmsterdam 1929","images":null,"inscription":"Inscription top right:\n'DVMPVER ALVEOLOF VRATVR MELLA CVPIDO // FVRANTI DIGITVM CVSPITE APIS // SICECIAMNOBIS BREVISE TPERITVRAVOLVPTAS // QVAMPETIMVS TRISTIMIXTA DOLORENOGET'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P374","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/lucas-cranach-the-elder-and-workshop-kronach-4892877-details.aspx?; accessed 01.06.2020]","role":"Artist","suffix":"and workshop"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"?
