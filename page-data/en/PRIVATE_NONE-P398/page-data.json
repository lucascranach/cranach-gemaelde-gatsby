Christ is represented with the crown of thorns on his head and covered in blood. He is clad only in a loincloth and a red cloak. The woman behind him pulls back this cloak to reveal his wounds, while further bearded gentleman observes events from behind with little compassion. At the right the stage-like architectural setting ends to reveal a small strip of mountainous landscape, a solitary tree and a distant town. A crowd of angry Jews and soldiers spills into the pictorial space from this direction.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 54.6 x 41.3 cm\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/studio-of-lucas-cranach-the-elder-4428315-details.aspx?; accessed 29.06.2020]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3805,"height":5517}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":290},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":580},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":870},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3805,"height":5517},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P398_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"Hebrew lettering on the hem of the man, wearing a blue gown and yellow robe, prominently positioned in the foreground in dialogue with Christ","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P398","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/studio-of-lucas-cranach-the-elder-4428315-details.aspx?; accessed 29.06.2020]\nor circle of?
