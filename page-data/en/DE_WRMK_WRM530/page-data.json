Jesus kneels in front of her and while pointing at her is about to write in Latin on the ground: 'Let he who is innocent throw the first stone'. The pair is encircled by a crowd of men, some dressed in very imaginative clothing, some already holding stones to punish the adulteress. From a gallery at a central vantage point two Pharisees watch the event, other men also look down. The apostles can be seen sitting behind Jesus.\n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 113.5 x 92 cm (addition of 10.5 cm on left side)\n[Cat.
