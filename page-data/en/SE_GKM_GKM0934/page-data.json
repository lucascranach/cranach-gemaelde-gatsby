The severed neck shines blood red while the eyes squint at the viewer. The motif is taken from the New Testament story of Salome, who avenged her mother's honour by demanding John the Baptist's head. It was a reward because she danced so seductively for her stepfather - and uncle - King Herod.\nThe story dates to the first century AD, but Salome is dressed in the height of fashion from the artist's own time: a late Renaissance gown in red and black silk, heavy jewellery, and high forehead. Behind the draped black cloth of the background, we glimpse forest, mountains, a river, and in the distance a fortified city, probably a landscape from the German artist's homeland. This way of moving a biblical story to new times and places was very common during the Renaissance.\n[Philippa Nanfeldt, Göteborgs Konstmuseum 2014;
