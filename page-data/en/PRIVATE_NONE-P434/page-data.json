The nymph reclines beside a spring, perhaps a reference to a legendary ancient Roman fountain with which a similar Latin verse was associated. The inscription on this painting, 'I am the nymph of the sacred spring, do not disturb my sleep. I am resting',  may be an allusion to the poem. Her bow and arrows hang from the boughs of a nearby tree, while partridges peck in the foreground and deer graze in the middle distance. However, the nude figure resting her head on the robe of a German court lady contributes another aspect to the idyllic scene by admiring herself beguilingly through lowered eyelids. The painting is intended both as an enticement and a warning to Cranach's sophisticated patrons.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: no information available","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":6552,"height":4525}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":138},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":276},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":414},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":6552,"height":4525},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P434_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- top left corner:\n'FONTIS NYMPHA SACRI SOMNVM NE -  // RVMPE QVIESC -'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P434","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Letter from D.
