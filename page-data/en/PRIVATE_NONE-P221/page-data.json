The wreath of flowers, the embroidered shirt, and the small bouquet of flowers in his right hand identify the sitter as a bridegroom. The year of creation (1535) and the age of the sitter are stated in the inscription at the top '1.5.35. ANNORU (M).AETATIS.21'. Small dark clouds take some of the lightheartedness from the joyful occasion of a wedding. Here the type of wreath and the pleated shirt with an embroidered stiff collar found in the painting of a betrothed couple in Leipzig are repeated. One focal point of the painting is the black band with tiny tassels to fasten the collar. A black coat trimmed with braids lends the sitter dignity. \n [Sandner, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 60.8 x 38.9 cm\n[Sandner, cda 2018]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3780,"height":5916}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":313},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":626},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":939},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3780,"height":5916},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":313},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":626},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":939},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3780,"height":5916},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P221_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"'1.5.35.
