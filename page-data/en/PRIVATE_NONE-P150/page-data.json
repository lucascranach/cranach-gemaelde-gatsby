Here the provenance of these almost identical versions were confounded. A composition with three figures by a 16th century artist from the Bergamo school, illustrating a very similar female figure and attributed to Bartolomeo Veneto in Sotheby’s auction catalogue, London 20.05.1993, lot 12 was associated with the Viennese version. Dr. Klaus Grimm believes the painting to be ‚ohne Zweifel aus der Cranach-Werkstatt‘ (without doubt from Cranach’s workshop). Dr. Werner Schade and Ludwig Meyer on the other hand consider it to be the work of a northern Italian master.\n\n[Dorotheum online database: https://www.dorotheum.com/de/l/5590389/; accessed 24.06.2020]\n[cda 2020]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1525,"dated":"about 1530 - 1537","end":1542,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 128, No. 293]"},"description":"The sitter laughs while she looks over her right shoulder at the viewer, her hair is loose and a chain decorates her neck. \n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 56 x 44 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 128, No. 293]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1371,"height":1707}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":249},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":498},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":747},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1371,"height":1707},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P150","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 128, No. 293]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 128, no. 293]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 56 x 44 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 128, No. 293]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1530 - 1537","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P150","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Portrait of a laughing Young Woman at bust length [Fragment]"},"objectId":838709,"objectName":"FR293","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- 1932 Eduard Jones Collection, New York\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 128, no. 293]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"128","referenceId":"417","title":"Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979"}],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"None","sortingNumber":"1531-013-01","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"56.00","width":"44.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of a laughing Young Woman at bust length [Fragment]","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":249},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":498},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":747},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1371,"height":1707},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P150_FR293_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
