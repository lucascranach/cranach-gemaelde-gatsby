She has raised her left arm and the hand rests on her head. With her right hand she points the short dagger towards her. It is raised and touches her right breast. Lucretia wears a red, fur-trimmed, embroidered gown over her shoulders and under this a transparent undergarment is visible. Her blond hair is pinned up and covered with a thin veil.\nLucretia wears numerous pieces of jewellery: a thin linked chain, a linked choker set with precious stones and with a pendant, a bracelet and two rings.\nThe background is dark.\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 75 x 56 cm\n[expertise D.
