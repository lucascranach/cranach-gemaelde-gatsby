The proud Pharisee stands directly in front of the altarpiece dressed in a magnificent, ceremonial gown. Several columns support the vaulted ceiling of temple interior that is shown in one point perspective. A plaque is attached to the column at the left in the middle ground, bearing the words of the Pharisee in Latin. In translation they read as follows:¿ I thank you Lord that I am not like the others'. Between the columns and the altarpiece three men are conversing, while in the background a group of traders go about their business. The Publican enters from the right; he has removed his hat and bows his head, while placing his hand ruefully on his chest. A column next to the entrance displays a plaque with his words, which translated read: 'Lord, please have mercy on this sinner'.\n[Görres, cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 97.5 x 74.3 cm\nDimensions including frame: 110 x 86.5 x 3.4 cm\n[Museo Lázaro Galdiano, online database 2016]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4993,"height":6472}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":259},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/01_Overall/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":518},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/01_Overall/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":778},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/01_Overall/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4993,"height":6472},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/01_Overall/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/01_Overall/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3450,"height":4430}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":260},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001r-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":520},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001r-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":780},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001r-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4993,"height":6488},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001r-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001r.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":257},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001v-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":514},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001v-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":770},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001v-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3450,"height":4430},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001v-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004/12_KOE/ES_FLG_5696_FRSup004_KOE_Overall-001v.dzi"}}]},"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- on a card attached to a column on the left:\n'D[OMI]NE .
