Russoli (1955, p. 141), which already suggested that chronological reference, rightly noted that in this \"Subtle grace of tiny handwriting\", you can still see the memory of Altdorfer. Both the iconographic point of view and the composition of the two works reveal a strong influence of North Italian painting, perceived perhaps, in this case, through Lombard models (the influence of Bergognone is particularly noticeable in the figure of St. John the Baptist).\n\nIt should however be noted that the morphology of the landscape little corresponds to the one that the painter usuallyproposed in the second decade of the sixteenth century, a background of trees of very similar to this one appears in an Adam and Eve, dated 1549, which according to ancient documents it is for Lucas Cranach the Younger. \n \n[http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/userfiles/1037_1038.pdf] (accessed 21.05.2013)","year":2013}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1545,"dated":"1550 - 1552","end":1557,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1545","end":"1555","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Exhib.
