Chrysler, Jr. 71.484 \nLucas Cranach the Younger was trained by, and worked alongside, his famous father Cranach the Elder, who served as court painter to the Electors of Saxony and often used his art to promote the Protestant cause of his friend Martin Luther. At the Elder's death in 1553, Cranach the Younger inherited his busy workshop and carried his father's style into the late sixteenth century. With its broadly modeled figures and bright colors flatly applied, the schematic design of the painting here typifies the Cranach shop style - a style intended to convey narrative as simply and directly as possible. As told in John 8:2-11, the Pharisees, hoping to trap Jesus in an intellectual double bind, confronted him with an adulterous woman and demanded she be killed for her crime as dictated by the law of Moses. Jesus deflected their challenge by answering, \"Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone.\" (That text, in German, is inscribed along the painting's upper edge.) Filled with shame, the defeated Pharisees dispersed. Cranach depicts the story's climax: As the Pharisees clamor for an answer, Christ points compassionately at the adulteress and forgives her sin. Luther himself preached on the theme of Christ and the adulteress, reminding his listeners that any sinner, if repentant, could be forgiven in \"the kingdom of Christ.\"\n[http://collection.chrysler.org/emuseum/copyright/7565?t:state:flow=442ca83a-10eb-4cb0-a3f7-1e2180b204b0] (accessed 14.04.2014)","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1527,"dated":"1532 - 1537","end":1542,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1537","end":"1557","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 364]","text":"after 1537"}],"remarks":"[Chrysler Museum of Art, revised 2015]"},"description":"This is an oil on panel painting. The panel contains evidence of eighteen people, although, for some only the tops of their heads can be seen. The perspective is in close range, bringing the viewer into an intimate space. Christ is in the center wearing a red robe over a bluish gray tunic. His left hand holds the wrist of the adulterous woman, his right points two fingers at her. She wears an orange dress, the bodice of which is slightly torn open revealing her breast. She wears a thin filmy scarf around her shoulder and over her head. Her eyes are cast downward. To Christ's right are two white bearded men, they seem to be in discussion with Christ. The one man in the foreground has a bag of rocks; he clutches one stone behind his back. Each man has a different facial expression as well as distinct features: there are no perfect generic faces, they are all very individual. The man in soldier's garb on Christ's left in the foreground looks directly at the viewer, as if suddenly he is aware of being observed.\n[http://collection.chrysler.org/emuseum/copyright/7565?t:state:flow=442ca83a-10eb-4cb0-a3f7-1e2180b204b0] (accessed 14.04.2014)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 74.3 x 121.9 cm (29 1/4 x 48 in.) \nDimensions including frame: 96.5 x 144.8 x 8.9 cm (38 x 57 x 3 1/2 in.)\n[Chrysler Museum of Art, revised 2015]","exhibitionHistory":"- Bonn 1935\n- Birmingham, AL; Washington, D.C.,  Atlanta, GA; Columbus, OH; Dallas, TX; Columbus, GA; New Orleans, LA; West Palm Beach, FL; Columbia, SC; Chattanooga, TN.
