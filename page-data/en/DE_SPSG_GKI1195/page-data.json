The tree, which is split down the centre, indicates that they belong together and were originally displayed next to each other. […]\nInspired by Dürer’s famous engraving (1504) and his paintings (1507) Cranach and his workshop have depicted Adam and Eve in more than 50 versions, either on two separate panels or together on one, in different sizes and poses as well as against different backgrounds. The function of these paintings has not yet been completely clarified and probably varied. They may have been used as wing panels, but are also associated with the ‚Weiberliste‘ and warn against female seduction and a disregard of God’s commandments. As the paintings in Berlin were executed in 1537 together with the Passion cycle they may also like it have been intended for the collegial church (Stiftskirche); however as yet no evidence confirming their use as wing panels could be found. Therefore it is conceivable that they were displayed as an ‘Exempla of Virtue’ in a corresponding decorative scheme in a room of the Berlin palace.’\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.
