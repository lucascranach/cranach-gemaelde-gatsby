This portrait was probably intended for some high official of the electoral court of Saxony. The artist depicts the Duke with a corpulent appearance and dressed in Northern style. His condition as elector of Saxony is emphasized by various elements, such as the letter 'S' embroidered in pearls on his ruff collar, the sumptuous chain with a pendent, and the fur clothing.\n\nCranach worked for Johann Friedrich on several occasions, making portraits for court members between 1532 and 1533. These works always satisfied the image of power demanded of them, and that is the principal characteristic of most of his portraits. Moreover, in his portraits, the artist usually captures his models' personalities with admirable veracity, as can be seen here in the mixture of pride and authority that emanate from this image of the Saxon elector.\n\n[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/johann-friedrich-ldquothe-magnanimousrdquo/](accessed 10.09.2012)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 20 x 14 cm\n\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":712,"height":1012}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":284},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none_2008_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":569},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none_2008_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":853},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none_2008_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":712,"height":1012},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none_2008_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none_2008_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"ES_MNdP_P07798","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2013]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"Verso:\n- top left corner: \nred wax seal (serpent ?)\n- centre:\npainted on paper: alliance coats-of-arms \n- bottom:\npaper attached to the reverse with a handwritten inscription in black '[F]asque!'; in red chalk: '132 [?]'\n\n\n[cda 2013]","locations":[{"path":"España > regions > Madrid > provinces > Madrid > inhabited places > Madrid","term":"Madrid","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"España > regions > Madrid > provinces > Madrid > inhabited places > Madrid","term":"Madrid","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 20 x 14 cm\n\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1533","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"ES_MNdP_P07798","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07798_FR-none_2008_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Johann Friedrich \"the Magnanimous\""},"objectId":541690,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Museo Nacional del Prado","provenance":"- acquired 2002\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"- CH_KMB_1228_FR336A, 20.6 x 14.5 x 0.3 cm (original)\n- DK_SMK_KMSsp725, 20 x 14 cm","repository":"Museo Nacional del Prado","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"- original size may have been trimmed slightly\n- marks from old frame fittings top, bottom and side\n- some old overpaint and retouching\n\n[cda 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2013","endDate":"2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"07.
