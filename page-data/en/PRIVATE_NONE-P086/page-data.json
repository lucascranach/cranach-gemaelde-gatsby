This crest conforms with that found in the woodcut, also by Cranach, dated 1534 (fig. 1). A second woodcut of 1537, also the work of Cranach or his studio, features the same sitter (fig. 2). Despite a differently styled beard and a more elaborate costume, the composition remains close to the painted portrait and may have been loosely based on it, or indeed after a lost painting. \nThis portrait was executed in 1534, three years before the second print, when the sitter had just returned from Italy, where he had studied law at the prestigious University of Padua near Venice. Laudatory Latin epigrams below the two engravings refer to the sitter’s humanist training, for instance the 1537 print is inscribed: ‘Hanc prae fert, stans, oransque, Scheyringus/Divini iuris Caesareique decus/Launger hunc phoebus cum Pallide iactet alumnum’ (Scheyring offers this face in front [of you], standing, and speaking/worthy of the divine right of the Caesars/Phoebus with Pallas bestow laurel on this protégé). The young jurist later enjoyed a varied career serving as burgomaster or mayor of his native city Magdeburg from 1539 to 1542, and entered the service of two German princes: appointed advisor to the Duke of Braunschweig in 1535; and chancellor to the Duke of Mecklenburg in Schwerin in 1555. Having embraced the ideals of the Reformation, like Cranach himself and many of his other patrons, Scheiring was part of the Protestant delegation sent to Emperor Charles V in 1540.\nThe sitter’s supreme self-confidence along with the various attributes he displays are unmistakable references to his status and accomplishments: the scroll alludes to his legal training and humanist learning: the elaborate sword evokes his noble extraction and knighthood; and his lavish costume reinforces his elite status and excellent taste. The sitter sports a bright white slashed doublet and has matching breeches with a fashionable codpiece, emphasizing his youthfulness and virility. His voluminous sleeves are partly covered by a dark cape. The sitter prominently displays his bejeweled hand against his chest, calling the viewer’s attention to the elaborate pendant emerging from his doublet. This attire is particularly extravagant at a time when even the highest-ranking member of society wore predominantly somber attire […] Johannes Scheiring understood the importance of fashion and outward appearance as a complement to, rather than a distraction from, his intellectual and spiritual ambitions. It is no coincidence then that he chose the most fashionable artist of the day to paint his portrait.\n\n[Auct. Cat.

Two pieces of evidence confirm that the present sitter is Dr. Johannes Scheiring: firstly, the coat-of-arms on his ring is the same as that on the woodcut showing his coat-of-arms completed by Cranach in the same year [Geisberg 1929, 646] and bearing the inscription: 'Joannes Scheiring Magdeburgensis Patricus, eques auratus, Vicecomes palatinus, Artium et u. j. [utrius juris] doctor' – secondly, a woodcut portrait of Dr. Sch. with a Cranach insignia from 1537 (according to [Geisberg 1929, 646] by Cranach the Younger) evidently draws on the same portrait type. Only the shape of the beard has been slightly altered. The woodcut depicts the distinguished laywer from Magdeburg at the age of 32. Therefore in the present painting he is represented aged 29.' \n\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 344]","year":1979}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1534,"dated":"1534","end":1534,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"Half-length portrait of Dr. Johannes Scheiring in a white slashed doublet and black cape, holding a scroll in his right hand. \n[Auct.

It has been thinned, backed and cradled\nquite long ago, and it is hard to tell if there were any original joints. There are various old cracks: one from the lower\nleft edge runs in for about a third of the width of the panel, another runs in more briefly from the right edge slightly\nhigher up, then the main cluster of old cracks crosses the central shoulders, with a few other minor little cracks in the\nmiddle just above.\nIn general the lower half of the painting is well preserved with a fine even craquelure throughout, including in the\nblack drapery and the slashed doublet and the hands. There is slightly more wear in the lower hand than in the finely\nintact upper one with its magnificently detailed rings. The stomach has had a little faint old strengthening, but\nelsewhere the drapery is in beautiful condition. Characteristically the under drawing can just be seen in places\nthrough the naturally increased transparency of the paint.\nIn the centre the craquelure becomes wrinkled and distorted from raised flaking in the past, and is mottled with old\nretouching. The signature in the background to the left has been worn and a patch of overpaint blurs the date. The\npaint surface on the left side of the face is crinkled and fractured, with many little retouchings, as also is one other\npatch at the upper right of the forehead. However between these two patches are the finely intact eyes, nose and\nmouth, with the beard and eyebrows also very well preserved. The delicate detail of the pleated shirt just below the\nbeard is perfectly unworn.\nThe bluish/ greenish background is largely in good condition, with a little retouching around the outline of the head\non the right, a broad band of repaint down the left edge in part over the signature and date at lower left and in\nscattered spots over the upper left background. The very evident old discoloured restoration makes a clear contrast\nwith the beautiful areas of intact original.\nThis report was not done under laboratory conditions\n\n[Auct. Cat.
