St John trows back his bare-head with blond curls and stares into the far distance beyond the crucifix petrified in pain. His interlocked and cramped hands are lowered in front of him, the palms facing out. [...] Both figures are shown close to the shaft of the cross, which they turn toward at a slight angle giving the impression of a shallow space. The splendid movement created by the calligraphic flourish of the fluttering loincloth is quite late gothic. It draws both figures closer together, and the rising wavy line of the tip cast over the head of the Virgin emphasizes Christ's inclined head and at the same time helps to close the gap between the accompanying figures and Christ's body. \n[Degen 1953]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1511,"dated":"about 1516 - 1517","end":1522,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1510","end":"1520","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Degen 1953, 196]","text":"about 1515"},{"begin":"1511","end":"1521","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Sandner 1998 B, 85]","text":"about 1516"}],"remarks":"[Cat.
