Sweetser Fund\n\nNOTES: \n[1] According to a letter from Betty Mont of Frederick Mont, Inc., to the MFA (April 4, 1970), an inscription on the reverse of the painting reading \"Colonna\" suggests it was with the Colonna family in Rome. Because this inscription is not legible today, this cannot be verified. Mrs. Mont believed the original frame to have been made in Italy and date to the 16th century. An Italian label was removed from the reverse of the painting and the panel bears an old Italian inscription, \"Lucas Cranach / Olandese del Sec.o XV\" (Lucas Cranach / Dutch, 15th century [sic]). \n\n[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, revised 2013]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"391, 487","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.
