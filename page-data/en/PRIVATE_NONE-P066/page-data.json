Both hands grip the broad dagger at the bottom right edge of the painting, which she has turned on herself. \nLucretia wears a fur-trimmed coat, which rests on her right shoulder. Beneath she has a transparent undergarment on. Her hair is pinned up with two curls either side of her face. A transparent veil covers her hair. She wears a necklace set with pearls and precious stones and a long linked chain as jewellery. \nThe background is dark. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: \n74 x 49 cm\n[Handwritten annotation D.
