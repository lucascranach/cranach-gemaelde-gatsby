Old worm channels were truncated and revealed when the panel was thinned, which probably occurred when it was cradled. However this treatment has affected the stability of the panel. There are seven vertical battens glued to the reverse of the panel and six horizontal moveable members. Some of the joins were reglued before the cradle was attached, creating a slight step in the painted surface. \nThe wooden panel was fixed in a frame during the application of the ground, a barbe is visible along the top and bottom edges. At the top and bottom edges the ground and paint layers begin c. 0.8 cm from the edge of the panel. In places the ground seeped under the rebate where it extends almost as far as the edge of the panel.\nIn numerous areas tow was applied to the front surface of the panel before or after the ground application, but not over the joins. There are no wood defects or inserts visible where the tow was applied. These tow applications are now visible on the painted surface as circular shapes in relief. this is presumably due to previous solvent action that has swollen fibres and has caused raised paint layers or paint loss. \nThe paint layers are stable, except along the joins where flaking has occurred due to the lack of adhesion between the ground layers and the wooden surface of the panel. The surface is slightly dirty and exhibits abrasion caused by incorrect use of solvents in the past. Along the joins original paint has been covered by a generous application of fill material. In addition in many places the original paint is covered by extensive retouching. The older retouches have discoloured or are no longer fully present, so that many filled losses are only covered by a thin or no paint layer.\nThe yellowed coating is particularly apparent in the lighter areas. Aesthically this is not notably disturbing, but the thick, glossy varnish is very unpleasant. It has filled the cracquelée and covers the entire surface in a very thick layer, giving it the appearance of plastic.\n[Laura Resenberg, Ferdinandeum 2014]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"02. 2014","endDate":"06. 2014"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"20.

The painted surface was cleaned first dry and then with a slightly damp sponge (Mikroporenschwämmchen, Deffner & Johann). Then the varnish was first thinned employing a mixture of Isooctane and Isopropanol (50:50 volume parts) and removed as far a possible. In the dark areas of the painting previous solvent action had rendered the paint very sensitive to the solvent mixture making it soluble. Here a thin layer of the old varnish was retained. The blackish-grey painted area with the rocky outcrop in the background was particularly affected. In contrast the green or lighter zones were surprisingly robust with resect to the action of the solvent mixture. \nThe old, thickly applied retouches and overpaint that extended beyond the areas of loss were removed with undiluted Isopropanol or mechanically with a scalpel. The extensive fills covering the area along the joins, where the planks were not flush, was removed mechanically with a scalpel under the microscope. A considerable amount of original paint was revealed. \n\nLosses were filled with a glue-chalk fill material. A dammar varnish was applied with a ball to achieve a thin isolating layer. Then the surface of the fills were isolated with schellac. Retouching was carried out employing Gamblin Colors using 1-Methoxy-2-Propanol as a diluent.\n\nFinally the painting was sprayed with a thin application of dammar varnish and polished with a soft goat hair brush. It was then fitted in the frame with a glass pane (flabeg ARTControl 100) with UV-protection. The rebate of the frame had been  cleaned and a slip was inserted to ensure a suitable distance between the pane and the surface of the painting. The slip had been painted black and cushioned with felt strips fixed in place with methylcellulose. A backboard was mounted on the reverse.","signature":{"date":"20.
