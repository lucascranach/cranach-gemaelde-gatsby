It can therefore be assumed that the painting was among the original decorative features of the electoral residence commissioned by  Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous. [...] \nIn addition to the present panel 17 other paintings by Cranach were transferred to Dresden in the year 1657. Among these four panels of about the same format are part of a unified group of works. In addition to the present image the other panels, now also in Dresden, show depictions of 'David and Bathsheba', 'Solomon's Idolatry' as well as 'Salome with the Head of St John the Baptist' [DE_SKD_GG1923]. In fact each panel shows how easily women through their physical attraction and beguiling nature have since biblical times managed to tempt men to actions often with fatal consequences. Such 'Weibermacht' cycles in which men are shown as victims of female deceit and to which 'Aristotle and Phyllis' and 'The Fall of Man' can be added are frequently documented since the Middle Ages. Two of Lucas van Leyden's woodcut cycles depicting the the 'Weibermacht' illustrate the popularity of this group of motifs at the beginning of the 16th century. Koepplin highlights the fact that Cranach was the first artist of his time to introduced subjects from the 'Weibermacht' into the field of panel painting and thus made them available for representational decoration within early modern residences. Accordingly the old testament subject of Samson and Delilah had before Cranach only been illustrated in the graphic and decorative arts north of the Alps. \n[Exhib. Cat.

However he only possessed his superhuman powers as long as his hair was not cut. In response to repeated cajoling by his lover Delilah he revealed the secret of his strength to her. Here Cranach illustrates the direct results of this moment of confidence. In the foreground the panel depicts the old testament champion fancying himself in elusive safety with Delilah. Samson, who is dressed in armour and yet barefoot, is stretched out at his lover's feet with his head on her lap. The woman exploits the hero's trust and takes advantage of the situation to cut his hair and thus deprive him of his virility. In the background the awaiting Philistines are shown approaching the scene to overcome and capture the invincible one.  While the jawbone lying in front of Samson recalls his past victorious battle against the Philistines, two partridges at the left may be a reference to the unbridled libido or - as suggested by the abundance of fruit on the trees - to the temptation of man to sin. \n\n[Exhib.
