Without doubt the present painting was neither created in the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder nor in the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger.\nLead tin yellow was identified in the paint layers and as according to current knowledge this pigment  was only rarely in panel painting after 1750 and only rediscovered in 1940, I presume, that the present painting was created after 1945.\nThe feigned alteration of the painting's dimensions and the artificially produced cracquelée are significant proof, that the present painting is a deliberate fake. The version in the Royal Collection in London probably served as the model.\n\nSUMMARY\nAs a result of this examination I consider the present painting Apollo and Diana to be an imitation of a Cranach painting with false intent. Stylistic comparison and evidence from the technical examination leave no doubt, that this painting was created outside the Cranach workshop. In my opinion the painting can probably be dated to the second half of the twentieth century. \n[Heydenreich, examination report 2009, 4]","year":2009}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1950,"dated":"1950 - 1999","end":1999,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"\"Second half 20th century\" [Heydenreich, examination report 2009]"},"description":"The painting depicts Apollo and Diana in a landscape setting. The Goddess of Hunting sits on a stag in the centre of the image. Apollo, standing to her left, is not completely represented. The subject was depicted in numerous variants by Cranach and his workshop.\nThere are similar versions in among others the Royal Collection, London (c. 1530, FR271A), in the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels (c. 1530, FR 270) and in the Gemäldegalerie Berlin (1530, FR 271). This painting is comparable in composition and some details with the version in the Royal Collection, London. In this painting the figures are considerably larger than in versions known to be from the Cranach workshop. \n\n[Heydenreich, examination report 2009]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 73.3 x

[1] Chalk, lead white, lead tin yellow, azurite and charcoal black were used for panel painting in Europe, including the Cranach workshop.  \nGreen earth could not as yet be identified on any painting from the workshop of Lucas Cranach, nor is the pigment recorded in Cranach's surviving invoices. The use of orange ochre containing barite and a cerium compound has not been documented on a Cranach painting either. \nThe azurite pigment pparticles employed in the landscape background are particularly coarse. By contrast the Cranach workshop employed very finely ground azurite to execute sky and landscapes. \nFlesh paint \nThe flesh paint was executed with an initial layer consisting of an admixture of lead white and vermilion pigments. The areas of shadow were relatively crudely modeled employing semi-transparent reddish-brown and grey glazes and the highlights were added with a lead white admixture. The x-radiograph appears very patchy. It confirms that the painting process was precisely planned and carried out with few alterations. The style and technique employed to execute the flesh paint differ considerably from works securely attributed to Lucas Cranach and his workshop. In particular the distributioin of lead white visible in the x-radiograph  provides evidence of a divergent technique in the modulation.\nSky and landscape \nThe sky was laided in with an admixture of lead white and azurite and subsequently toned employing reddish-brown glazes. The grey underpaint that is generally found in the sky on Cranach paintings from this period was not detected on the present painting.  It was not standard practise in the Cranach workshop to modulate the sky with reddish-brown glazes. The foliage in the middle-ground was laid in with reddish-brown paint. Subsequently single leaves were modelled employing dark to light green paint. This technique is also untypical of Lucas Cranach: on Cranach paintings it is more common to observe a brownish formation on the edge of leaves resulting from discoloured final glazes.\nThe difference in style and technique from works securely attributed to Lucas Cranach and his workshop is also apparent in the execution of the architecture in the background. The reinforced  contours of the city-scape are particularly unusual for Cranach. \n[1] Poll-Frommel, Stege, Untersuchungsbericht (2009), 2."}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"None","sortingNumber":"1950-002","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"7.30","width":"51.30"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Apoll and Diana","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":282},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none_2009_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":564},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none_2009_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":845},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none_2009_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2320,"height":3269},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none_2009_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P017_FR-none_2009_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
