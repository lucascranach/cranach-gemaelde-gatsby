This particular likeness is the last among Cranach's many Luther portrait types. The prototype, signed and dated 1539, is perhaps that recorded by Friedländer and Rosenberg in the collection of Dr. Emile Isambert in Paris [1]. The design was produced many times in the Cranach workshop in the 1540s and 1550s and beyond under the direction of Lucas Cranach the Younger. The portrait of Luther was often paired with a companion portrait of his friend and associate Philip Melanchthon (1497-1522). Good examples, from the hand of the younger Cranach himself, are in the Kisters Collection, Kreuzlingen [2].\n\n[1] M.J. Friedländer and J.

There is a vertical join and a vertical crack to the panel descending through the sitter's head. The lower right hand and left hand corners have been restored. There is worm damage to the reverse of the panel and this has worked its way through to the surface where worm hole damage is significant and restoration has been undertaken to reduce this. Thinned paint to the face and the background has been augmented. Beneath a discoloured, opaque and degraded varnish, covering the black robe, can be seen further restored losses. The writing on the book is abraded and there are restored losses visible.
