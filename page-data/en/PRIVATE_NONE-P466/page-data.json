Her head is inclined slightly to the right and her gaze is cast inwards. She touches her head with her left hand, while holding a dagger pointed at her chest in her right hand. Her attire is completed by a black band, holding back her blond hair, a bracelet and two necklaces, one a large, linked chain and the other a choker with a pendant. [cda 2020]\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. Depictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century.
