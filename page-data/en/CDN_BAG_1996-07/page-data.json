Koepplin Archive).

A fur-trimmed coat covers her naked upper body and her blond curls are pinned up under a pearl bonnet. She wears a necklace with pearls and precious stones. Beneath her breasts the tip of the dagger is visible. There is a curtain depicted in the background.\n[Herrschaft, CDA 2011]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 31.1 x 23.5 cm (fragment)\n[Beaverbrook Art Gallery, revised 2011]\n\n12 1/4 x 9 1/2 in.\n[Montreal Museum label on the reverse of a photograph in the Archive D.
