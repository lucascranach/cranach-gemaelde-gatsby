It frames the title page of the first edition of Luther's 'Vom Reich Christi', together with similar portraits of Elector Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous and Luther.[1] In addition to the example in Kassel nine further versions exist of this  double portrait type bearing the date 1543. They vary only slightly in the background colour. [2] The standardisation and the number created within one year suggest that they satisfied a large order, which served to disseminate an 'image', which had found its definitive expression for both reformers.[3]\n[1] Exhib. Cat. Basel 1974, 389f., under No. 268; Cat. Kassel 1997, 84, fig. 55. Although the woodcut was not produced in the Cranach worshop the model was probably created there. \n[2]Cat. Kassel 1997, 86. Examples are the version in Schloss Gottorf (on loan from a private collection, Exhib. Cat. Bremen 2009, Nos. 10/11, fig.) and that sold in an auction in London (Sotheby's), 10 July 2008, No. 104.\n[3] See Warnke 1984, 61 f.; Hinz 1994, 175. Kurt Löcher presumed that a supply was painting in advance and that the date could refer to the year the firat version was created and not the later repetitions, see Löcher, Cat.
