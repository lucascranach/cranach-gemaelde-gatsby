As such, this tender depiction of the Virgin and Christ child with the sleeping infant Saint John the Baptist can now be recognized as one of Lucas Cranach the Younger's most powerful private devotional panels. It is simultaneously a poignant celebration of familial love between a mother, her son and young cousin, and a dramatic image designed to stimulate religious devotion in the viewer through the contemplation of the mystery of the Eucharist.' \n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-ii-the-virgin-and-child-5649706-details.aspx; accessed 20 Feb 2018]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1537,"dated":"after 1537","end":1545,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-ii-the-virgin-and-child-5649706-details.aspx; accessed 20 Feb 2018] \n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 148, No. 386]"},"description":"'Set against a dark background free from distracting landscape elements, the three figures in the present painting are set close to the picture plane, fostering a more direct engagement with the viewer. This pictorial immediacy is underscored by the illusionistic treatment of the grapes that the Christ child offers with his left hand. With a deliberate control beyond the capability of a mere infant, Jesus has plucked a single grape from the bunch and brought it to his lips. As he begins to consume the fruit, he directs a wise yet imploring gaze toward the viewer, calling to mind Christ's words 'this is my blood', which he spoke at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:28).'\n[Christie's Online database; https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-ii-the-virgin-and-child-5649706-details.aspx; accessed 20 Feb 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of
