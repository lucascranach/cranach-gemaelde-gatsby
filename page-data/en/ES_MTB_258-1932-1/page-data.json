The inscription at the upper left corner includes the sitter’s age and the date of the painting but her identity remains unknown, although the rings on her left hand suggest that she belonged to a burgher family. The choice of colours for the clothes create a lively contrast with the background: the skirt and sleeves are red, the bodice is black, and the white of the areas near her face increase its luminosity. The head and face are extremely delicately painted, as are this young woman’s eyes, which look to the left and reflect a light that enters from outside the pictorial space.\n[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, revised 2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 62 x 39.8 cm\n[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, revised 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"Munich 1930","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1704,"height":2750}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":323},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR232B/01_Overall/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR-232B_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":646},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR232B/01_Overall/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR-232B_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":968},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR232B/01_Overall/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR-232B_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1704,"height":2750},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR232B/01_Overall/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR-232B_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR232B/01_Overall/ES_MTB_258-1932-1_FR-232B_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- top left corner:\n'ANNO.ETATIS.ZG.'\n[cda 2019]","inventoryNumber":"ES_MTB_258-1932-1","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, revised 2019]\n[Lübbeke 1991, 62, no. 10]\n[Christian Salm, Cat.
