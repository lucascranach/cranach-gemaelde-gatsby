Troschke 1939, 26-27 identifies them with the unconfirmed names Georg (left) and Katharina (right). Both children wear the same clothes and are holding hands. The boy holds an apple in his hand and the girl holds grapes. Only the red feathered plume on the boy¿s hat and the hair wreath worn by the girl serve to identify their gender. Both stand against a blue background on a heavily vegetated ground.  \nThe composition is framed by a boarder gilded with gold leaf. This encompasses an empty text field beneath the double portrait.\n[Görres, cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support (parchment sheet): 37.5 x 25 cm\n[Willing-Stritzke in Exhib. Cat.
