The immediate models for the panel are the single portraits of Luther and Melanchthon by Lucas Cranach the Younger, signed and dated 1557 (Hamburg, Galerie H. Rudolph) [2]. The Reformers were often shown together in altarpieces by Cranach the younger, but the Kress panel is the artist’s only known painting devoted exclusively to their portraits.\n[1]Friedländer, Rosenberg, No. 252\n[2] Illustrated in Weltkunst, XXII, 1952, 11, No. 21. An earlier portrait of Luther by Cranach the Younger, close to the panel is dated 1560 (FR423). Lucas Cranach the Younger’s woodcut portrait of Melanchthon of 1560 (B.90) follows that of the panel in reverse.\n[http://www.kressfoundation.org/uploadedFiles/Kress_Collection/European%20Paintings%20Excluding%20Italian_catalogue.pdf, 41, K2179]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1558,"dated":"1558","end":1558,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"Melanchthon (1497-1560) is shown at the right in a deferential pose, in characteristic 'deshabille', holding a closed book with both hands. [1] He turns to the left toward the posthumous image of Luther (1483 -1546) who is far larger in bulk, in three-quarter view, facing right, holding an open book (the Luther Bible?) with both hands. Both men are shown in half-length, hatless, in academic garb, against a pale grey-blue background in a composition of extreme horizontal format. Melanchthon's tunic (beneath his gown) is in a style fashionable earlier in the century. The sobriety of their attire is relieved by the band of red (Luther) and a red tunic (Melanchthon). Luther was a close friend of the painter's father, who (with his studio) portrayed the Reformer at least forty times. Melanchthon, the theologian, humanist and scientist, is shown frail and ailing, two years before his death.\n\n[1] for portraits of Melanchthon, see Zimmermann 1960, 127-30; Thulin 1961, 180ff.\n\n[http://www.kressfoundation.org/uploadedFiles/Kress_Collection/European%20Paintings%20Excluding%20Italian_catalogue.pdf, 41, K2179]","dimensions":"Dimension of support: 59.4 x 88.3 cm (23
