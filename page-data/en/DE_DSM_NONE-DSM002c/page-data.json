The central and larger coat-of-arms applied to the diocese of  Naumburg and the family von Schönberg, the smaller flanking coats-of-arms also applied to the house of  von Schönberg as well as the Pflug family. Flechsig therefore assumed that the triptych was a donation by the Bishop Johannes von Naumburg, son of Heinrich von Schönberg and Ilse Pflug, who died on the 26th of September 1517.
