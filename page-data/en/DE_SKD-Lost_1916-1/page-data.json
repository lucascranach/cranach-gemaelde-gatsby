Lucretia's body is shown from the front, whereas her face is inclined slightly to the right and she stares into the far distance. In her right, raised hand she holds the dagger pointed towards her breast. The tip is pointed down and has already injured her breast. She draws the end of the veil across her body with her left hand.  It is so transparent that it does not even cover her vulva. In addition to the veil she wears a neckband and her hair is pinned up beneath the veil. The background is dark and neutral. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 172 x 64 cm\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 141, No. 358] \n[Exhib.
