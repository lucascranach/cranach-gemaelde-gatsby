She is shown as a half-length standing figure, facing to her left against a dark background, while holding her sword in her right hand. The general's decapitated head rests on a marble sill in front of her. Judith is wearing a sumptuous dress with puffed sleeves and brocade bands. A snood covers her hair and a wide-brimmed velvet hat with feathers completes her head attire. This outfit is complemented by a neck band set with precioius stones, a large linked chain and elegant white gloves with decorative slits revealing her rings. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 39.7 x 26.7 cm \n[Letter appendix from Linsay, Fine Art, London to D.
