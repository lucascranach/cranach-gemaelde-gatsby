[1] Schuchardt attributed the stag hunt to the younger Cranach on the basis of stylistic criteria.[2] Whereas Engerth conjectured that the son assisted only with the ‚accessories‘ Scheibler agreed with Schuchardt’s attribution.[3] In the Museum guide from 1896 Scheibler’s opinion is accepted, however it was retracted in the reprint from 1907. At length since 1928 the Stag-hunt has been attributed to Lucas Cranach the Younger in the catalogues of the Kunsthistorischen Museum.[4] Friedländer and Rosenberg view the painting in Vienna, as well as the Stag-hunt, dated 1540 and now in Cleveland, as variants after the painting in Madrid from 1545 and are inclined to consider it ‚preferably‘ as a work by Lucas Cranach the Younger, whereas they attribute the later paintings in Madrid to the Elder.[5]\n \nThe electoral pair from Saxony, Johann Friedrich and Sibylle, as well as their most prominent guest Emperor Charles V are clearly recognizable.[6] In the background the castle Hartenfels and the town of Torgau can be easily identified.[7] From 1928 it was assumed that not Charles V. but his brother King Ferdinand (later Emperor Ferdinand I.) was among the hunting guests.[8] In 1969 Hilger pointed out that King Ferdinand did not grow a beard until after 1547 and that therefore it could only be Charles V. portrayed in this hunting scene.[9] Friedrich II of the Pfalz can be seen directly in front of the emperor.[10] The Golden Fleece as well as the coat-of-arms of the Electoral Palatinate in the top left corner support this assumption.[11] \nThere are various suggestions regarding the identity of the crossbow archer in greyish blue clothing standing beneath the tree: Oberhammer assumes it is Duke Ernst of Braunschweig-Lüneburg (1497-1546).[12] The other suggestion is that Duke Philipp I of Braunschweig-Grubenhagen (1476-1551) could be the archer under the tree.[13]\nThe hunt was already the subject of artistic expression at the court of Emperor Maximilian I.  by about 1500 (see Jörg Kölderer, ‚Stag-hunt on the Long Lawn near Innsbruck, Illustration in  Emperor Maximilians I.’s ‘Tirol Hunting Book, 1500).  Therefore from the beginning of his career as court painter in Wittenberg Cranach also dealt with this subject.  His earliest Hunting Scene is a large woodcut, dated to 1506 (Bartsch 119): The composition of a hunt in the countryside, shown from a high viewpoint, can already be found quite early in Cranach’s repertoire. It may be assumed that numerous such depictions were executed on ‚tuchlein‘ or as wall-paintings for decorative purposes and have not been preserved.[14] There are however some panel paintings and fragments of hunting scenes which have survived from the Cranach workshop: The earlier ones can be dated about 1530 (e.g. Kunsthistorisches Museum, GG-3560; Kopenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst, Inv. KMSsp728; Linköping, Länsmuseet Östergötland, Inv. B. 244; Glasgow, Burell Coll.). The later versions are from the 1540s and are with dimensions of c. 115 x 170 cm larger formats: among these are, in addition to the painting discussed, one from the castle of Moritzburg from 1540 (now in Cleveland), a panel in the Prado from 1544 and another painting also there from the year 1545 (see related works). \n \nThe paintings created in the 1540s are not only similar in size and composition, all four also depict the castle of Hartenfels and the electoral pair Johann Friedrich and Sybille of Saxony among the participants at the hunt. \nThe hunting scenes in Cleveland (1540) and the Prado (1544) show, although not quite accurate in detail, the south east elevation of the castle complex.[15] \nA different elevation is shown in the painting discussed here from 1544 and the second painting from 1545 in Madrid: here the Northeast facade facing the Elbe is shown and to the left the whole Johann-Friedrich wing (as such the prominent ‚green tower‘ occupies a central position). A further feature of this wing is the ‚bottle tower‘ with its winding stair. The castle chapel, rising over three floors, is located in the right section of the wing, and as the first new protestant church building was consecrated by Martin Luther on the 5th of October 1544.[16] \n \nIt has already been established that an historical hunting scene has not been documented, as Charles V. was never in Torgau before the Battle of Mühlberg.[17] The hunting scenes from the 1540s were conceived as gifts for other ruling houses and should convey a symbolic statement: the commissioner of the painting, Johann Friedrich of Sachsen, was the commander of the Schmalkaldic League, the military alliance of protestant landlords in opposition to the emperor. In the painting the opposing parties are shown hunting together. The recently modernized castle of Hartenfels, positioned centrally in the background, is shown as a representative residence but also as the centre of the new faith. In the years before the Schmalkaldic war there was still hope, that the question of faith could be peacefully resolved with Charles V.  It was not until after the Battle of Mühlberg that this option no longer existed under Charles V.  The hunting scenes in Madrid and Vienna therefore convey the elector’s political ideal.[18] Represented as a hunter in front of his imposing residence the elector presents himself to the contemporary viewer as a wise, able and determined territorial prince, capable of asserting his religious political goals.[19]\n\n\n\n\n[1] A.

The present cradle is already the second. In the 1950s it replaced an old cradle that may have been attached to the reverse in 1933 (see Conservation Reports).\nThe panel was to varying degrees cropped on all four sides during this intervention and the clear dimensions were increased by attaching two battens, each 0.6 cm in width, to the top and the bottom of the panel. Along the side edges of the panel the original unpainted edges were in places covered with fill material and integrated with paint. In plank V there is an old split, which extends from the edge of the panel tot he centre in the direction of the grain. In the area of the women (right edge, plank IV) a split is beginning to develop on the reverse. In plank II there is a fracture line (glued and filled). The original inserts in planks I and II (see Material/Technique) are visible as slight indentions.  \nAlong the top edge, cropped to the greatest extent during the alteration of size, there are numerous paint losses that have been filled and retouched. Along the join between plank V and VI there are larger paint losses.

At either side near the edge of the panel – however not specifically over joins [4] - an application of loose fibres was determined. \nThe original dimensions of the panel have been altered by cropping it at the top and bottom (at the bottom somewhat beyond the unpainted edge, and at the top somewhat more – see truncated coats-of-arms) and adding wooden battens.[5] The panel has been thinned to a thickness of 0.4-0.5 cm. \n\n\n\n\n[1] Measured from top to bottom\n[2] Height 3.1 cm l. / 2.8 cm r. x width 45.7 cm\n[3] The dimensions of the left insert: height 2.2 cm  x width  2.4 cm, and the right insert: height c. 2.7 cm x width 2.9 cm \n[4] A series of x-radiographs were completed on selected areas of the painting therefore the precise location of the fibres can only be confirmed to a limited extent.\n[5] each batten is 0.6 cm in width."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- light ground (bulking material/binding medium were not analysed).\n- the barbe from the ground and the unpainted edges have been preserved at the sides, these are 1.2 (t) 1.0 (b) cm in width at the left and 1.4 (t.) 0.9 (b.) cm at the right.

The flesh paint consists to a large extent of grey paint, whereby the flesh paint of the elector is particularly cool and contains hardly any red. The flesh paint of the other figures appears to have been underpainted in a grey admixture and subsequently variously nuanced with warmer red tones. \nThe hinds in the water appear to have been thinly painted and the light base tone of the water was employed for the heads, in other words the artist exploited the ground, toned only with a thin grey glaze. Over this countless single impasto hairs were applied with a very fine brush overlapping the surrounding paint. \nThe green areas were applied first in the sequence of paint application and the figures and animals followed. Finally the space in between was filled with grass blades or wavy lines where the stags are in water. Similarly the pebbles appear to have been painted last between the figures without overlapping.\nThe sky was evidently painted over a layer containing a high quantity of lead, exhibiting  a high x-ray absorption. It becomes lighter and contains reddish tones nearer the horizon and has an increasingly higher blue content towards the top of the panel. The castle appears to have been executed over an underpainting that was still wet (see the brush strokes in the x-radiograph).\nAlong the contours of the hunters and the dogs as well as along the riverbank a local streaky application of grey underpaint is visible in the landscape that is not completely covered by the subsequent paint layers. The grey tone was presumably at the same time employed to indicate the shadows of the figures.  \nIn the area of the trees a black base tone was initially applied with a bristled brush and green foliage was smudged over the in part wet paint with a dry brush, before single leaves were dabbed on employing a thick lighter green paint. The bark (central foreground) was executed by dabbing on white, yellow and red tones with a brush (Fig. Detail 12).\nThe background landscape along the horizon was executed with a few, fine brushstrokes over a bluish-green base tone. \nThe gilding on the coat-of-arms was applied directly over the paint layers without an adhesive. \nFinally details like water splashes, hair, highlights on the swords and light leaves in the trees were added with an impasto paint application. The swords of the elector and his companions were added over the raised leaves very late in the painting process. \nThe paint was often applied wet-in-wet to achieve specific effects. This method can be observed on the branches of the antlers, where a light impasto application was executed over the brown base tone and in part painted wet-in-wet with a second tone. Another example illustrating the quick succession of paint application can be observed in the elector’s cross-bow, where dark details were drawn in the wet light base tone with a brush. Details of the clothing or the lines of the waves were also painted wet-in-wet in white and black or grey paint.  \nNo pentimenti could be detected, only the windows of the castle have been shifted slightly.[1]\n\n\n\n\n[1] The dark paint layer from the first application is visible through the subsequent light paint layers."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"new frame \n[Tüchler, Kunsthistorisches Museum, revised 2013]\n[Transtation, Smith, cda 2013]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["10_Analysis/AT_KHM_GG856_FR412C_2013_analysis-report-001.pdf"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Peter Klein","role":"analysed by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"08.04.2013","endDate":"08.04.2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"16.
