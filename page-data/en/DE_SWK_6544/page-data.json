The legend is well known that when St Veronica saw Christ carrying the cross she took pity on him and wiped his face with her veil and its image was impressed on the cloth as Vera Icon (true image). [...] Whereas the heads of the henchmen touch on caricatures, because ugliness is equated with the force of evil, the faces of the men on horseback remain comparatively detached. The wonderful old head of Simon of Cyrene stands out in the composition. One of the henchmen kicks Christ to get him to rise. The grieving friends, St John and the Mother of God are not readily visible in the image, nor are the two bare-headed thieves at the right edge. The soldier who kicks Christ bends his head so far down that only his nose is visible beneath the cropped rim of his hat. \n[Löcher, in Cat.
