While there are no exact matching compositions in the oeuvre of Cranach or his workshop, a number of related elements can be in found in renditions of the same subject, such as the much larger panel in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (oil on panel, 31 7/8 x 44 7/8 in. [AT_KHM_GG3678]). The quality of certain passages in the present panel are extremely accomplished and close to Cranach himself, in particular the attenuated modeling of the figures and the naturalistic treatment of the animals.'\n\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5287765; accessed 24.02.2020]","year":2010}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1530,"dated":"about 1530","end":1530,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Letter D.

Eve is caught in the act of handing an apple to a perplexed Adam. Entwined around the tree's trunk, the serpent with a female torso and head looks on as Adam succumbs to temptation. Behind them in the middle distance is a vine heavily laden with fruit and a small pool of water. A rich menagerie of birds and animals - a stag, a hind, a roe-buck, a moose, sheep, a bear with its mate, a lion, horses, a wild boar and a hound, as well as two pheasants and a partridge with her chicks - completes this seductive vision of Paradise. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50.8 x 38.1 cm (20 x 15 in.)\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5287765; accessed 24.02.2020]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2800,"height":3340}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":263},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":526},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":789},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2454,"height":3228},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":239},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":477},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":716},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2800,"height":3340},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"none","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P324","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5287765; accessed 24.02.2020]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5287765; accessed 24.02.2020]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 50.8 x 38.1 cm (20 x 15 in.)\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5287765; accessed 24.02.2020]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1530","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P324","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P324_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Garden of Eden"},"objectId":972721,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- the property of a New York family\n- sold by Christie's, New York, Sale 2282, 27.01.2010, lot 315\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5287765; accessed 24.02.2020]\n- aquired by De Jonckheere, Paris\n[Letter De Jonckheere, Paris to D.
