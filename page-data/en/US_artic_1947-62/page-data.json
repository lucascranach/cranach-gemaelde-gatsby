They proposed that the date should more properly be read as 1538, a deduction that is confirmed by microscopic examination (see Technical Note).[1] The picture thus belongs to the period when Lucas Cranach the Younger became his father's dominant assistant, after the death of his older brother Hans late in 1537. Friedländer and Rosenberg implied that the Art Institute's Crucifixion was the prime version among a number of other treatments of the subject from the late 1530s. It should be noted, however, that Cranach's workshop tended to produce variations of a theme rather than repetitions of a prototype, and it remains difficult to separate the contributions of Lucas the Elder, Lucas the Younger, and other workshop hands at this time.\n[1] [Rich 1929] [Exhib.

Raised high above the throng of soldiers and gesticulating onlookers, Christ is here the living savior rather than the more conventional figure of death with bowed head, closed eyes, and pierced side.[2] The good thief, crucified at Jesus's right hand, gazes up at him with acceptance, while the bad thief, who mocked Christ (Luke 23:39-43), looks away, his less worthy character signalled by his awkward body type. Continuing this conventional division of positive and negative on either side of the cross, the mourning friends of Christ occupy the lower left corner of the composition. The swooning Virgin is supported by Saint John the Evangelist and by a woman whose relatively rich dress suggests that she represents Mary Magdalene. Opposite these holy figures are the soldiers who cast dice to determine who will take possession of Christ's clothing (Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:24; Luke 23:34; and John 20:23-24). Their expressive, gnarled features contrast with the smooth, pale faces surrounding the Virgin. In a pivotal position between these two groups, a father points the cross out to a small boy. The child's acid yellow tabard and his silhouetted profile give this motif some prominence in the welter of figures.\n[1][Roth 1967]\n[2]Hausherr 1971]\n\n[Cat.
