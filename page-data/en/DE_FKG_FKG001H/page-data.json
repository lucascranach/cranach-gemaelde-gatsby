This would support the hypothesis that the whole work was created in Wittenberg in cooperation with the Cranach workshop. […]\nThe painted scenes from the Legend of St Nicolas are without doubt by the same Cranach pupil, who in about 1515/16 painted the Highaltar for the Church of St Nicolas, Döbeln. However the contribution from assistants is considerable. The scenes of the Passion are by a completely different hand, but the assistance can be recognized of artists who probably worked on the wing panels of the altars in Gleisberg and Boritz.[…] \nA number of artists - at least three - were responsible for the execution of the panels. The authorship by the master who had already worked for Döbeln is not only recognisible in the recurring representation of the Legend of St Nicolas, but also stylistically. The head types, the treatment of the water and the clouds, the landscape and the colour of the draperies all indicate his hand. Typical characteristics of the underdrawing confirm this judgement. There is however no doubt that the compositional and dramatic concentration of the work in Grimma is less accomplished than that in Döbeln. […]\nThe images from the Passion recall those of Cranach’s workshop without necessarily stemming from there. Although the assistance of the artist from Freiberg cannot be distinguished, the stiff, almost linear forms of Christ’s arrest and flagellation recall the style of his apprentices assisting in Gleisberg and Boritz. Cranach’s influence appears mainly limited to the Crucifixion, and the Presentation of Christ. Kurt Degen [Degen 1953] has already pointed out the close relationship between the Crucifixion and Cranach’s version [DE_KSG_GM704]. \n[Sandner 1993, 146-148]","year":1993}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1514,"dated":"about 1519","end":1524,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Lorenz 1856, 7, 100]"},"description":"The outer wing panels of the altar depict Christ's passion, while the inner wing panels (the 1st transformation) illustrate the Legend of St Nicolas. The shrine contains almost life-size wooden statues of various bishops, among them St Nicolas.\nLike in Döbeln the church patron St Nicolas is the centre piece of the open altar. Beside him rank Erasmus [...] and a bishop holding a book and a ciborium (?) (Donatus of Arezzo?). The wings of the shrine contain saints Barbara and Margaret on the left and on the right Christopher, the patient bearer of 'divine burden', and a saint whose attribute is now lost (Leonard?). The predella contains a relief representation of the Nativity with a painted scene of the Annunciation to the Shepherds in the background. \n\nThe St Nicolas series, which is the most complete version in Saxony, faithfully illustrates the stages of the saint's life.
