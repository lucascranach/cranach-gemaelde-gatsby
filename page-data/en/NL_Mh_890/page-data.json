His body fills the lower half of the pictorial space. The collar of a white shirt trimmed with fine lace peeps out from beneath the black gown with decorative slits on the sleeves. The folds of the plain gown and the ruffled sleeves are barely visible in the dark cloth. The monochrome clothing directs the viewer's attention to the face with its animated, emphatic expression and the soft rendering of the features. The sitter gazes pensively into the distance. His hair and beard are executed with great precision. Fine brushstrokes defining single white strands in the wavy hair, the curls over his ears and particularly in the beard animate the face like highlights. \n\n[Katja Schneider, Exhib. Cat.
