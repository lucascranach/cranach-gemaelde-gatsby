The shadows are modeled with brown glazes (with a visible amount of black).\nBlue pigments have been added to the cooler highlights. The pupil is blue and the eyeball also contains blue pigment. On comparison with the underdrawing the right upper eyelid has been lowered slightly in the painted version.\n    \nHeadscarf\nThe headscarf was painted essentially with a mixture of lead white and a reddish brown lake like pigment (single red lake pigments). The underdrawing appears to have been incorporated to create the modeling of the shadows. The brownish amber coloured ‚Pigment‘  appears to be semi-transparent and not solid.  The cause of the numerous crater-like recesses in the paint surface requires more investigation.  \n \nBlue Draperies   \nThe Virgin’s blue robe was painted wet-in-wet and modulated with varying proportions of lead white. The image is not clear in the x-radiograph. The paint has been applied more thickly than in other areas of the painting.\n    \nRed undergarment \nThe undergarment was essentially modeled in red lake glazes and in this respect is quite different from St John’s robe.\n    \nST JOHN\nFlesh Paint\nThe painterly execution of the head was relatively complete before the position of the head was altered.  It is clear from the x-radiograph that the head, which was originally inclined towards the Virgin was straightened slightly and turned more towards the viewer. \nThe highlights on the light flesh tone were applied with a lighter paint made cooler by the addition of blue pigments. The shadow was achieved essentially with the application of brown glazes. \nThe initial paint layer of the lips was carried out in vermilion red with white highlights and modulated with a red lake glaze.\nThe outer contours of the left foot were painted with the same paint as the floor. \n \nRed draperies\nThe underpainting of the robe is modulated with a mixture of red and lead white in varying quantities. Subsequently the shadows were applied in red lake and black (?). Slight corrections of the contours are visible in the area of the left shoulder and the hip.\n \nCHRIST \nA light coloured application of flesh paint was applied over the underdrawing of the body, which had been modulated with washes. The highlights were added with a smooth to dabbed application of paint containing a greater proportion of lead white. \nThe body of Christ appears more three dimensional in the x-radiography. Blue pigment was added to the light coloured flesh paint.\n \nLoincloth    \nThe yellowish brown (amber coloured) glazes contain small quantities of very finely ground red pigments and red lake. A micro-craquelée extends out from the semi-transparent brownish inclusions.\n    \nLANDSCAPE\nThe branches of the trees without foliage were partially executed before the paint of the dark clouds was quite dry.  The glazes employed for the shadow on the trunk of the beech above the cross were spread with the finger or the fist. \n \nThe foliage has an initial dark application of paint. Single leaves were subsequently painted in a lighter green and differentiated with a semi-transparent glaze. The now brownish appearance of the glazes is probably to a greater extent the result of ageing. \nThe paint applications overlapalternately: while the initial layer of dark green paint was applied over that of the Virgin’s headscarf, the white highlights on the scarf were applied later. The greenish brown glazes on the other hand were applied over the headscarf. \n    \nThe foliage was held in reserve when the blue sky paint, which contains varying proportions of blue pigments (appears to be azurite) and lead white, was dabbed on.  The dark clouds additionally contain some black pigments.\n \n- No gilding was detected on the painting."}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["10_Analysis/DE_BStGS_1416_FR005_2006_analysis-report-001.pdf"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Peter Klein","role":"analysed by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"30.03.2006","endDate":"30.03.2006"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"27.
