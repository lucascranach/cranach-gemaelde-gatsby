In the Book of Moses it serves to guide the Israelites to safety. In this small rectangular panel Moses is placed at the centre of the composition, pointing a stick towards the pillar of cloud that rises out of the sea on the left. The pillar appears to support a representation of God’s head. The Israelites occupy the right side of the composition, entering from behind a rocky outcrop. Soldiers are at the head of the group following Moses.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 22 x 46.5 cm\n[G.
