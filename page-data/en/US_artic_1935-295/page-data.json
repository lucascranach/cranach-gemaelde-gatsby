Although the general placement of Adam and Eve in these paintings reflects the influence of Albrecht Dürer's renowned classicizing treatment of the same subject in paintings and prints, Cranach's slender, undulating figures conform to the contemporary courtly ideals of beauty. This pair is one of the finest of the many versions of the subject made by Cranach and his workshop.\n[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/21668?search_no=7&index=0] (accessed 24.09.2012)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:  107.5 x 36.4 cm (42 5/16 x 14 5/16 in.)\nDimensions of the painted surface: 105.7 x 36.4 cm (41 5/8 x 14 5/16 in.)\n[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/21668?search_no=7&index=0] (accessed 24.09.2012)","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":850,"height":2440}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":613},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1226},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1839},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":979,"height":3000},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":574},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1148},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1722},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":850,"height":2440},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":574},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1148},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1722},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":850,"height":2440},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1935-295_FR197/01_Overall/US_artic_1935-295_FR197Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_artic_1935-295","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/21668?search_no=7&index=0] (accessed 24.09.2012)","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > states > Illinois > counties > Cook > inhabited places > Chicago","term":"Chicago","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > states > Illinois > counties > Cook > inhabited places > Chicago","term":"Chicago","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on beech wood\n[Cat.

In addition, fluid greyish black lines establishing the contour of the figure are evident in several areas inside the painted contour of the flesh area. Thin translucent washes of paint laying in the figure overlap these lines. In some areas, The contour is selectively reinforced with a final fluid line of brownish black paint over the flesh, for example under the chin, on the inside of the forearm, and on the left shoulder.\n[1]For this type of underdrawing as characteristic of Cranach see [Billinge et al. 1997, 29]\n[Cat.
