According to statements preserved in two funeral sermons from 1631 and 1632 he was brought up in the court of the Saxon electors, was groom of the bed chambers, Hoftruchsess (highest court official, responsible for the management of the palace, supervision of the personal, the kitchen and the table). As court counciller of the Ernestinian saxon Elector Friedrich II. the Wise (1463 - 1525, ruled 1486 - 1525) he travelled with him in 1493 on a pilgrim journey to Palestina and attended almost all imperial diets, was a member of the teutonic knights, was in personal contact with Luther and was employed among others to implement Lutheran church improvements in large courts in and outside Germany. He assisted John the Steadfast in the suppression of the peasants' revolt. He was buried in Collm. \nThat such a figure did not commission a larger painting can at least be doubted. \n[Harold Gaudlitz, unpublished research 2013]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1515,"dated":"about 1520 - 1530","end":1535,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1513","end":"1525","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Exhib.
