The wooden construction, which is 1.20 m in height, is mounted on a solid projecting stone at a height of c. 2.20 m. The left side of the pulpit with the entrance is shaped like a semi-circle whereas the right side with the lectern is rectangular. \nThe pulpit is decorated with six illustrations of the Life of the Virgin as well as the Life and Passion of Christ. Each scene is separated by a carved pilaster showing Hermes. \nAbove the paintings there is a carved frieze, 34 cm in height, depicting putti in tunics recalling Roman legionary uniforms alternating with different coats-of-arms. In the background green tendrils with predominantly red fruit have been painted behind the carving. There is a wooden base of 14 cm in height with a carved geometric decoration beneath the paintings, which finishes with a profiled batten. Above the pulpit is an abat-voix, which is decorated on the underside with a depiction of the Trinity on a gilded ground. This depiction is surrounded by angels on a blue background, holding the instruments of martyrdom. The painting is framed by a carved egg and dart ornamentation. The top of the abat-voix is decorated with a crown.\nThe six pulpit paintings illustrate - from left to right - the following subjects:\nThe Annunciation, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Baptism of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection. The lectern is located above the Crucifixion. \n \n[Herrschaft 2013, 18-19]","year":2013},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"As the central subject of the Passion the Crucifixion of Christ is the most important motif in christian art. According to the Gospel of St John his mother Mary and his favorite disciple John were present, as in this depiction. Also represented are the felons crucified with Christ. \nThe significance of the motif is made apparent by the numerous examples from the workshop of the Elder and Younger Cranach: the so-called 'Schottenkreuzigung' (1501, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), the Crucifixion in the Niedersächsischen Landesmuseum (about 1520 – 1525, Hannover), the Schneeberger Altar (1539, St. Wolfgangkirche, Schneeberg) and the Colditzer Altar (1584, Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg), to mention only a few. The paintings referred to are multi-figured compositions, where in addition to the figures mentioned in the gospels other attendants are shown, among these the soldier with the vinegar sponge and some henchmen, morning women and the converted centurion. \nIn addition there are also a few less animated depictions like in the Alte Pinakothek (about 1515 – 1520, Munich) with Jesus between the thieves, the Virgin, St John and Mary Magdalene as the the only attendants. For quiet devotion the crucifixion alone can dominate the motif, like for example the small crucifixion in Dublin (1540) and the crucified Christ in the Lutherhaus Wittenberg (1571). Christ's pose in the crucifixion scene of the Augustusburg pulpit is similar to that of both the above mentioned, but in comparison with the Augustusburg altarpiece of a lesser quality. \n[Herrschaft 2013, 29-30]","year":2013}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1573,"dated":"1573","end":1573,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"Christ is depicted frontally nailed to a T-shaped cross with three nails.

The contours of the figures were described with delicate, sometimes repeated lines, which are binding to a certain degree. The indicated arrangement of the folds serves again only as a rough orientation. Executed in straight, angled and curved as well as wiggly lines the design was first corrected and clarified during the painting process. However, one alteration within the composition did occur at the underdrawing stage. The figure of St John was initially one centimeter further to the right and was then shifted and redrawn.\nIn contrast to the Baptism scene the background of the Crucifixion was not indicated with a few fleeting lines. Instead the townscape exhibits some binding lines for columns, walls and windows, that were carried out with short strokes. These may have been transferred from a pre-existing design and/or carried out by another person.\n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 41]"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The paint layers probably consist of pigments bound in oil (a test for protein proved negative). On all the panels the paint layers extend to the edge at the sides - like the ground - whereas the paint layers at the top and bottom end before the ground. \nBy and large all the panels exhibit a very economic painting technique with a thin application of paint, which nevertheless is predominantly opaque. In addition there are areas of glazed colour, where the imprimatura is occasionally visible and influences the colour scheme of the panel. \nThe quality of the painting is very mixed and reveals the cooperation of more than one person on each panel. Many of the affectionately executed details are only visible close up, which considering the position of the panels 2 meters above is never possible. Other areas are less precise and occasionally unfinished (this is also the case for the decorative painting on the pulpit).\nAreas of the flesh paint are less subtly nuanced than in the Nativity and Baptism scenes. The faces of the Virgin and St John were painted in a darker grey over an initial brown layer and the subsequent flesh tone was more thickly applied. The hands of St John and Jesus were executed in a similar manner. In contrast the feet of Jesus are much softer and more accurately painted with more extensive use of flesh tones. Even the individual veins have been modulated.\nSt John's red robe was executed with a very thin application of paint allowing the ground to shimmer through and the brushstrokes are also visible. The paint is an admixture of vermilion and ochre, with an increased addition of white for the lighter folds. His coat is bright red and may again contain vermilion. Shadows and folds were executed employing a dark glaze.\nThe Virgin's robe was, like in the annunciation scene, executed in paint containing smalt over a grey paint layer. The upper section of the sky is roughly executed in dark blue paint, which was applied more thinly for the clouds so that the ground shimmers through and the brushstrokes are visible. The paint was appplied criss-cross in short strokes. Azurite was employed as the blue pigment, over which (in part) a layer containing smalt was applied. After the application of the blue paint layers the lower edge of the central layer of clouds was finished with rough brushstrokes in red paint. Finally the volume of the clouds was defined employing delicate lines of white, yellow and pink along their underside. The section of the sky above the horizon was painted yellow. Within this zone areas were left in reserve and the imprimatura was covered with a thin grey glaze to indicate clouds. Some yellow lines give the clouds their shape. \n\n[Herrschaft 2013, 56-58]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["05_UV-light/DE_SKAU_NONE-SKAU002B_2013-05_UV-light.tif"],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"05. 2013","endDate":"05. 2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"13.
