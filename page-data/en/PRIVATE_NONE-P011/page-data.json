And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst' (Luke 23:44-5). Cranach exploits the divine wind accompanying the eclipse to extraordinary pictorial effect by having Christ's loincloth describe a supremely elegant double arabesque. The rocky landscape beyond, still not covered with darkness, is graphically rendered with swift and virtuosic outlines.\n[Christie's Online Database, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-christ-on-the-cross-5701772-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5701772&sid=2c667680-ea34-4d68-bdf5-96e504b1186f, accessed 10 Oct 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 41 x 25.8 cm\n[Christie's Online Database, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-christ-on-the-cross-5701772-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5701772&sid=2c667680-ea34-4d68-bdf5-96e504b1186f, accessed 10 Oct 2017]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2746,"height":3930}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":286},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":572},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":859},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2746,"height":3930},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2763,"height":3939}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":285},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/02_Reverse/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Reverse-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":570},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/02_Reverse/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Reverse-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":855},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/02_Reverse/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Reverse-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2763,"height":3939},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/02_Reverse/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Reverse-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/02_Reverse/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Reverse.dzi"}}]},"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"Reverse of the panel: A seventeenth-century inscription, running over the entire back of the picture, indicates that it belonged to Alamanno di Stefano, a member of the retinue of the papal nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini (1592-1653) during their mission to Ireland at the time of the Confederate War of 1645-1649. A native of Florence and a man of letters, named Archbishop of Fermo in 1625, Rinuccini was sent to Ireland by Pope Innocent X. With a cargo of weapons and monetary funds, Rinuccini aimed at providing decisive support to the Irish Catholics in their fight against the Protestant English forces. He sought to make Ireland an independent Catholic kingdom, and eventually, he might even have hoped that a victory in Ireland would be the starting point for a Catholic reconquest of England itself, then in the midst of the Civil War, but he returned to Italy, defeated, in 1649.\n[Christie's Online Database, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-christ-on-the-cross-5701772-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5701772&sid=2c667680-ea34-4d68-bdf5-96e504b1186f, accessed 10 Oct 2017]","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P011","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Christie's Online Database, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-christ-on-the-cross-5701772-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5701772&sid=2c667680-ea34-4d68-bdf5-96e504b1186f, accessed 10 Oct 2017]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Christie's Online Database, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-christ-on-the-cross-5701772-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5701772&sid=2c667680-ea34-4d68-bdf5-96e504b1186f, accessed 10 Oct 2017]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 41 x 25.8 cm\n[Christie's Online Database, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/lucas-cranach-i-christ-on-the-cross-5701772-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5701772&sid=2c667680-ea34-4d68-bdf5-96e504b1186f, accessed 10 Oct 2017]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1530 - 1535","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P011","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P011_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Christ on the Cross"},"objectId":916056,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- Alamanno di Stefano, member of Giovanni Battista Rinuccini's retinue on his papal mission to Ireland (1645-1649)\n- Charles A.
