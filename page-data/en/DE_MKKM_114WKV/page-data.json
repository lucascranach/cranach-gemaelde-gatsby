Beside them is a compact group of children and women some cowering fearfully on the ground. The reduction of the number of figures and the idiosyncrasy of the composition lends the panel a unique character. In the past this prompted a misinterpretation of the image as a depiction of Adam and Eve after Cain killed his brother. By transferring the conflict to the couple it also recalls motifs that are found on the panel in a private collection in Moscow as well as a silverpoint drawing in Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin.  \n[Carrasco, Exhib.
