He demonstrates that the recommendations by the Visitors to celebrate the service facing the community necessitated a freestanding altar and the installation of the retable on a separate pedestal - the situation we now find in Weimar. The inferred genesis of the work between mid 1554 and the end of 1555 suggests that Lucas Cranach the Younger and not his father designed and painted it. \nAccording to Böhlitz the peculiarities in the iconographical program as well as the content and form of the inscription on the predella (now lost) can be explained by the function of the retable as an epitaph altar. Overlooking the double tomb of Johann Friedrich I. and his wife Sibylle von Cleve, which is located directly in front of the altar, it makes reference to the Ernestine burial place in the Schlosskirche of Wittenberg. The tomb and the retable are an expression of the ‚entitlement policy‘ (\"Anspruchspolitik\") (p. 295) of the new Duke Johann Friedrich II, who sought compensation for the loss of electorship and territory after the Schmalkaldic war, and the addition of the portraits of Cranach the Elder and Martin Luther can also be evaluated within this context. \n[Görres, cda 2012]","year":null},{"author":"","date":"19.06.2012","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"Abstract of Görres 2007:\nOn the basis of considerations about the use of imagery by the Lutheran Church the commentary demonstrates how the relationship between the image and the viewer was structured in the case of the Weimar Retable by identifying and interrelating three levels of reception. The depictions of Martin Luther and Lucas Cranach the Elder can be contextualized on each of these levels and thereby show the intrinsic value of each level. Regarding the theological level the iconographical program of the central panel postulates a chain of prophecy extending from Luther to the present age of the contemporary viewer and through Luther’s close friend Cranach it presents a witness and prototype for the laity. Politically seen the Weimar Altar can be read with recourse to Luther as a disassociation from the teachings of the University of Wittenberg, which had since been lost to the Albertines. The Ernestines as long-standing employers of Luther lay claim to representing the absolute doctrine. Cranach, who had served them for decades, also appears as a herald of better times. Finally on the level of medial reception the commentary examines the intrinsic pictorial strategy with which the program of the retable assures a reception in accord with the Lutheran doctrine. Luther, likewise Cranach appear here as mediators of the Faith.   \n [Görres, cda 2012]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1555,"dated":"1555","end":1555,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":""},"description":"The inner side of the wing panel depicts Elector Johann Friedrich I. of Saxony on the left and his wife Sibylle of Cleve on the right with their sons Johann Friedrich the Middle (der Mittlere), Johann Wilhelm and Johann Friedrich the Younger who commissioned the altarpiece. All five figures are depicted kneeling on prayer stools wearing the same sumptuous black clothing with gold decoration and fur lining. The mother also wears a fur trimmed bonnet and a book lies open on the lectern in front of her.  The other family members have put their black feathered head attire on their prayer stools.  Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous, Johann Friedrich the Middle and Johann Friedrich the Younger look out of the painting, whereas Sibylle of Cleve and Johann Wilhelm look towards the central panel. The black throws covering the prayer stools are decorated with a gold-black border with different motifs. On the left flap there is the coat-of-arms of the Houses of Saxony and Cleve and on the right flaps these are combined to create the coat-of-arms of the sons. The coats-of-arms are depicted three-dimensionally and arranged parallel to the picture plane, whereas the prayer stool is positioned at an angle giving the impression that the coats-of-arms are not part of the pictorial reality. A floor with beige and red marble tiles extends across both wings. Similarly a gold-black brocade curtain hangs across the background of both wings. It is decorated horizontally with two alternating motifs showing variants of a vase with flowers between an organic braid band.  The curtain consists of two layers: on the left wing the front layer hangs over a rope stretched horizontally across the panel so that the letters 'VDMIÆ' on the border of the curtain are visible above the heads of the royal couple and on the right wing it is simply folded to the side.  \nWhen the altarpiece is closed the left wing shows the Baptism of Christ by St John. Jesus stands knee deep in the river Jordan, the ends of his loincloth float in the water, his arms are folded in front of his chest and he looks out of the painting. St John kneels behind him on the banks of the river with his left hand on Jesus' shoulder and with his right hand he pours the baptism water over his head. St John wears a fur robe in a reddish brown tone, and he is fully concentrated on the baptismal act. God the Father appears in the upper third of the painting surrounded by a cloud with winged angel heads and with a sign from a finger of his right hand he sends out the Holy Spirit as a dove. The dove floats down to earth with outspread wings in a similar aureole. The landscape is characterized by rich flora and is animated by a herd of deer in the background. The sun baths the rocky outcrop on the horizon in yellow light and at the same time illuminates the heads of St John and Jesus from behind. \nThe exterior of the right wing shows Christ in the familiar aureole ascending to heaven. There is a star-shaped nimbus around his head, he wears the red cloak and holds the victory banner, which this time only has a transparent shaft. His feet hover just above a grassy hill, where their marks are still visible. The event is encircled by a group of 26 tightly crowded figures, some only partially indicated with heads. Two of them are in the foreground with their backs facing towards us. They all appear to have fallen on their knees and look full of amazement and awe. The only exception is a young man with a short moustache, who looks at the viewer.\n\n[Görres 2006, 10-11]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 370 x 146 cm\n[Görres 2007, 23]","exhibitionHistory":"Berlin 1937, no. 137","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3744,"height":2092}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":497},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":994},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1490},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":771,"height":1915},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":112},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":224},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":335},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3744,"height":2092},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434/01_Overall/DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B_FR434_2010-04_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- on the edge of the curtain above the noble couple:\n'VDMIÆ'","inventoryNumber":"DE_PPW_NONE-PPW001B","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Böhlitz 2007, 294]\n[Schulze 2004, 104]\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 158, No. 434]\n'Cranachs Zusammenarbeit mit seinem Sohn in untrennbarer Werkgemeinschaft [...]' [Thulin 1955, 54] [Exhib.
