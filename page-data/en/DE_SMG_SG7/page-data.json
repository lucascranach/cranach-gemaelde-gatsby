It was recorded in 1513 among the 'Weibmacht' paintings decorating Johann the Steadfast's nuptial chamber in Torgau, while the panel in Copenhagen belonged to Albrecht of Brandenburg.[5] Against this backdrop the subject evolves - particularly within the context of the Saxon court which was well-disposed to reformation ideas - on two levels: on the one hand it alerts to the power of women, and on the other hand it  urges political prudence. \n[1] Generally: Smith 1995\n[2] Exhib.

Out of love to her Hercules allowed himself to be humiliated by wearing women's clothes and doing women's work like spinning wool, while he gave his club and lion's skin to Omphale. [1]\nAccordingly Cranach depicts Hercules in the company of Omphale's servants, who place a bonnet on his head. The hero is shown spinning a thread, that is tensioned diagonally between his hands and is pulled from a distaff by one of the servants. Hercules appears to follow the thread with his gaze, which leads to the servant, who looks out at the viewer, including him in the events. It is not by chance that a Latin inscription commenting the event is located beneath the image. It is translated as follows: 'The Lydian girls give Hercules' hands work; the sovereignty of his mistress tolerates that divinity. Ruinous lust seizes powerful spirits, and even the most capable minds are enfeebled by tender love.' [2]\n[1] Bischoff 1998, 154 f.\n[2] Zitiert nach Exhib. Cat.
