The Virgin holds the infant on her lap, while the elder of the three kings has fallen bareheaded on his knees before him, presenting him with a gold vessel. Christ grabs one of the coins from the container and returns the king¿s gaze. Balthazar the Moor stands behind him also holding a precious vessel, as does the third king.  He is already holding his hat in front of his chest and bows to give the infant his present, which is contained within a gold chalice. On the horizon in the far distant background a scene depicting the annunciation to the shepherds is visible. \n [Daniel Görres, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 85 x 56 cm\n[Exhib.
