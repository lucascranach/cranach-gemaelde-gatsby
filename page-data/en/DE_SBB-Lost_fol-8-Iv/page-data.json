He stands on a marble floor facing right and his cast shadow falls on the blue background in the niche. The Duke wears a fur-trimmed cloak and holds a book and a wreath of roses in his hands. A boarder with ten coats of arms with decorative helms runs around the niche.   \nIn the bottom left corner the year 1554 is recorded above the artist's insignia. This is illegible in the present reproduction of the lost sheet but is confirmed by other historical photographs.  \n[Görres, cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support (parchment sheet): 33 x 23 cm\nDimensions of painted surface: 30.5 x 20.5 cm\n[Troschke 1939, 20]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1980,"height":2953}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":301},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_1923_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":602},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_1923_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":902},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_1923_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3009,"height":4525},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_1923_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_1923_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":597},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":895},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1980,"height":2953},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Wahl 1935, 148]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32402","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on parchment \n[cda 2015]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support (parchment sheet): 33 x 23 cm\nDimensions of painted surface: 30.5 x 20.5 cm\n[Troschke 1939, 20]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1554","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SBB-Lost_fol-8-Iv_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Portrait of Georg III. of Anhalt [from the bible of Johann II. of Anhalt]"},"objectId":821217,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preußischer Kulturbesitz","provenance":"- the edition of the bible containing this sheet was commissioned by Johann II. of Anhalt (1504-1551) and belonged to him \n- in 1659 it was given as a gift by Johann Georgs II.
