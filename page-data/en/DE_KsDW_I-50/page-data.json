She wears a richly embroidered golden dress with a high collar as well as a golden hat with jewelled applications. A minature portrait of the artist is depicted in the pendant on her hat. She holds the hand of a c. 10 year old prince, whose royal origins are indicated by the red ermine coat. His dark blond hair has a page cut and he wears a decorated vermilion beret on his head. \n\n[Kulturstiftung Dessau Wörlitz; http://www.museum-digital.de/san/index.php?t=objekt&oges=16585; accessed 7 April 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 57 x 42.3 cm\n[Kulturstiftung Dessau Wörlitz;
