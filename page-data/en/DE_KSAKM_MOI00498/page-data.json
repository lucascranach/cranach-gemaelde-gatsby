He holds the glass rod of the victory banner in his left hand. The banner, which is also transparent, wafts in the wind. Christ's right hand is raised in a sign of blessing and his head is framed by a halo. The guards sleep around the sarcophagus, most of them are wearing armour, some awaken and are in turmoil at the sight of the vision before their eyes. The foreground of the painting is occupied by a family of kneeling donors divided between a group of eight males on the left and nine females on the right. In total six coats of arms are depicted on the painting. The three Marys on their way to Christ's tomb are visible in the far distance, while the sun rises on the horizon behind them.\n[Daniel Görres, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 158 x
