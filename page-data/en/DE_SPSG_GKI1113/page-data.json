[…] \n\nIn this portrait Joachim appears older compared with the Perini portrait [Exhib. Cat. Berlin 2009, 172-173, I.22], which is dated 1562 and therefore a later date is assumed here.\n\nHowever it is difficult to link the clothing and the jewellery with a date around 1570 as they appear more appropriate for a believer of the old faith. In 1563 Joachim publically announced and celebrated his conversion to the Lutheran Faith, but despite this he is not depicted here in the attire of a protestant duke. The elector exhibits the sumptuous representation style, which the Hollenzoller dynasty developed against the background of their prominent position in the empire. The occasion for this portrait may have been the prospect of an expansion of this region of influence. In 1569 Joachim II obtained common feudal rights for Prussia after many years of negotiation with the polish King, a success which was of extensive political importance. Researchers have identified the strikingly tall fur hat, which is unusual within German costume tradition, as a polish article of clothing. It is therefore plausible that Joachim wished to emphasize the close ties between the Electorate of Brandenburg and the polish King Sigismund II. August.‘\n\n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.
