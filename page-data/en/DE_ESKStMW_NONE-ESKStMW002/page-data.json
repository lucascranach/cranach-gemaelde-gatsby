The scene takes place on the top of a mountain, beyond a city is visible, which can be clearly identified as Rome. Christ stands at the centre of the image on top of a closed, rectangular sarcophagus, holding the victory flag and raising his right hand in blessing. He is surrounded by watchmen, some still sleeping - seven men in contemporary armour. His transparent rod is crowned with a gold cross and his cloak is red with a decorative golden border. In the distance on the left three women can be seen approaching from the city. \n[Harasimowicz, Kulisz, in: Harasimowicz, Seyderhelm  2015, 179, 180]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 150 x 100 x 2.5 cm\n[Harasimowicz, Kulisz, in: Harasimowicz, Seyderhelm  2015, 179]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4020,"height":6125}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":305},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":609},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":914},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4020,"height":6125},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4912,"height":7360}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":300},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/06_Detail/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Detail-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":599},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/06_Detail/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Detail-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":899},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/06_Detail/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Detail-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4912,"height":7360},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/06_Detail/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Detail-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none/06_Detail/DE_ESKStMW_NONE-ESKStMW002_FR-none_09-2014_Detail-001.dzi"}}]},"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"The epitaph originally had a silver and gold leaf gilded frame, which was decorated with coats of arms.
