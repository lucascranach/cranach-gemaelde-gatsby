Only Judas is shown separated, seated at the side of the table, Christ serves him something to eat. Set apart from the event by the front bench Duke Joachim of Anhalt kneels in the foreground wearing sumptuous robes and with his hands in an attitude of prayer. Standing beside a large bowl of water a cupbearer serves cold drinks and offers them to the participants of the dinner party. The signet ring on his left hand suggests, that this may be a self-portrait of Lucas Cranach the Younger. At the back of the stately renaissance room stands a group of five men, that have been identified as members of the Anhalt ducal house. On the right further dishes are handed to a servant through a service hatch. \n\n[GÃ¶rres, cda 2013]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 257.5 x 209\n[Mieth 1993,

Cruciger were applied thickly and exhibit soft transitions (see x-radiograph).\nThe marbled background architecture of the room, the tiles on the floor and in part the robes were executed employing the same technique. \nIn contrast areas painted with an opaque to impasto application were executed very meticulously, nevertheless in part delicately modelled contours were carelessly overlapped. (Tiles in the background bordering on B. Bernard's robes). \nThe white tablecloth with an impasto edging also overlaps the contours of some completed objects so that it appears stereotyped (see x-radiograph). \nFinal ornamental details on the robes, architecture and the portraits (hair, contours of the eyes and mouths) were added with delicate, impasto brushstrokes. \nA conscious decission was made not to carry out any  further examinations like cross-sections or pigment and media analysis as these were not strictly necessary to complete the treatment."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Underdrawing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The underdrawing lies directly over the ground. \nTwo designs for the Dessau Last Supper have survived [Schade 1993 A, 23].\nThe infrared photographs confirm that a one-to-one preparatory drawing was made.
