He is wearing a black gown with a white ruffed shirt beneath. His greyish hair has thinned at the top, in contrast his beard is dark and full. He holds an edition of the bible [?] in his right hand, while pointing to it with the index finger of his left hand. An inscription above the sitter’s head reveals his identity and his age. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 26.5 x 21 cm\n[Auct. Cat.
