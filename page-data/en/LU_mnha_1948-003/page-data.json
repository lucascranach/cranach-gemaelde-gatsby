Her head is tilted forward. A transparent veil covers her fashionably combed blond hair that falls in elaborate waves on either side. The veil extends over her high forehead to the almond shaped eyes that gaze dreamily at the viewer. A further child sits on her right knee and sucks on her right breast. A girl approaches from the left with an apple in her right hand and eats another apple held in her left hand. To the right of Charity another boy sits in front of the tree stump, holding an apple in his left hand and looking to the left. In the upper left quarter of the painting a landscape is visible with a castle on a rocky outcrop and a town located on a river or lake.\n[Michel Polfer, in Exhib. Cat.
