Here the appearance is also compromised by a yellowed varnish. In the light background the varnish is streaky and its application varies in thickness, abrasion with damage to the original paint layers is also apparent. There are also retouchings and overpainted areas, particularly along the unpainted edges of the panel. The flesh paint is more or less intact and only exhibits a few small losses. In particular there are large losses in the background next to the right ear.\nThe elector's robe is relatively intact. There only appear to be losses on the right hand and the fur-trimming.","processingDates":{"beginDate":"25.07.2014","endDate":"25.07.2014"},"project":"","remarks":"The yellowed varnish and old retouchings were removed with a solvent mixture of ethanol and acetone. The retouchings along the edge of the panel were less affected. These had to be removed mechanically under the microscope. After the varnish and retouchings had been removed the extent of the damage was revealed with numerous small losses and abrasion of the very thin paint layers. Particularly in the blue background where the paint layers were in part so thin that the light ground shows through. [...] \n\nThe edges of the panel are not painted beyond the incised lines. The paint application ends in this area, leaving the ground exposed. \nAfter the varnish and retouchings were removed the losses where the wood was exposed were filled. The the abraded areas and the fills were retouched with gouache paint. Then a new natural-resin varnish was applied. Isolated abraded areas were adjusted employing glazes with Gamblin Conservation Colors. \n\nSmall losses and scratches on the frame were retouched with gouache paint. Abrasion on the gold profile was reintegrated with gold power bound in wax. The panel was fixed in its frame employing steel pins, which were separated from the reverse of the panel by an acid-free board. \n\nsee also pdf","signature":{"date":"31.
