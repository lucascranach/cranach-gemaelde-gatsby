With one foot Christ kicks Death, a skeleton crawling over the tombstone, while standing with the other foot on the Devil, a dragon-like creature with a pig's snout and the horns of a ram. He places the end of the banner's glassy shaft on his head. \n[Löcher, in Cat. Schwäbisch Hall 2008, 84]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 72 x 41.5 cm\n[Cat.
