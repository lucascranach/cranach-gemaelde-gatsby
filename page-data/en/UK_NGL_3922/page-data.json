The central and right-hand parts of the hedge are lower, revealing a landscape background of tall mountains with distant buildings in the centre and on the far right. The men form two pairs: on the left a man holding a still leafy wooden stake lies on the ground with blood streaming down his back, his mouth open in pain; he is being beaten by a standing bearded man with a long stick. On the right lies a bearded man who has evidently just been beaten to the ground by the white-bearded man standing over him, who holds a long leafy stick. In the foreground, on the left, a woman turns open-mouthed to look at the scene, herself holding a stick with the sharper end upwards, as if to defend herself or one of the men. Another woman, standing centrally and clasping the wrists of two babies, appears to be speaking to her. In the right-hand corner of the picture, apparently oblivious to the fighting behind her, a woman reclines in the grass with her baby; it looks up at her over her shoulder, while the baby behind reaches down as if to grab its hair or pluck some grass.\n[Susan Foister, `Lucas Cranach the Elder, Primitive People¿ published online 2015, from 'The German Paintings before 1800' London,

In a sample from the green grass, this underpaint has a mid-grey tone and consists of lead white mixed with charcoal black and a little vermilion. In some places it can be seen to be thinly applied and streaky, for example in a small area at the right of the foreground where it is not completely covered by the green paint on top. Under the dark green of the background trees it is almost black, with just a little white and vermilion, and is again thin and streaky, as can be seen where it continues slightly beyond the foliage under the thin light grey rocks of the outcrop on the left. A similar thin dark paint is present under the blue parts of the sky and the distant mountains, rocks and buildings. The green paint is based on verdigris,[1] with varying amounts of lead-tin yellow and lead white. In the sky a mixture of lead white, azurite and a little pale red lake has been used. The flesh paint is composed of a mixture of lead white, red lake (with red fibres indicating that it was prepared from dyed textile shearings), black pigment of large particle size, and vermilion. More of this last pigment is present in the ruddier flesh of the standing men than in the pale flesh of the women. In general, the paint is quite thinly applied, although with slight impasto for highlights on leaves, and the small spots of white lichen on the trunk and branches of the trees at the left. In places it has been worked wet-in-wet, for example where it has been feathered to soften the contour at the edge of the central rock.\n[1] Verdigris was identified by ATR–FTIR imaging.\n[Susan Foister, ‘Lucas Cranach the Elder, Primitive People’ published online 2015, from 'The German Paintings before 1800' London, forthcoming.]\nwww.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/lucas-cranach-the-elder-primitive-people"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"None","sortingNumber":"1530-015","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"51.50","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Primitive People","type":"Titel"},{"remarks":"","title":"The Close of the Silver Age (?)","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":277},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_3922_FR263/01_Overall/UK_NGL_3922_FR263_2008-02_Overall-002-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":553},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_3922_FR263/01_Overall/UK_NGL_3922_FR263_2008-02_Overall-002-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":830},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_3922_FR263/01_Overall/UK_NGL_3922_FR263_2008-02_Overall-002-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1869,"height":2586},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_3922_FR263/01_Overall/UK_NGL_3922_FR263_2008-02_Overall-002-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_3922_FR263/01_Overall/UK_NGL_3922_FR263_2008-02_Overall-002.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
