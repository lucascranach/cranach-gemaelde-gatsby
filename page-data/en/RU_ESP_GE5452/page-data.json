All three are shown in three quarter profile and gaze to the right beyond the pictorial space, suggesting the painting was originally part of a larger altarpiece. The figurative group is set against a backdrop of trees and a rocky outcrop with a fortress. A family coat of arms with a red and white shield divided into four parts (party per cross) is displayed prominently in the foreground. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 32.5 × 12.5 cm\n[Hermitage online database, accessed 25.09.2020](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/38673/)","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":731,"height":1920}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":525},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1051},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1576},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":731,"height":1920},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"RU_ESP_GE5452","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Hermitage online database, accessed 25.09.2020](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/38673/)","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"Rossiya > republics > Rossiya > autonomous cities > Sankt-Peterburg > inhabited places > Sankt-Peterburg","term":"St. Petersburg","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"Rossiya > republics > Rossiya > autonomous cities > Sankt-Peterburg > inhabited places > Sankt-Peterburg","term":"St. Petersburg","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on canvas\n[Hermitage online database, accessed 25.09.2020](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/38673/)","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 32.5 × 12.5 cm\n[Hermitage online database, accessed 25.09.2020](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/38673/)"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1518 - 1520","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"RU_ESP_GE5452","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Portrait of a Knight and His Two Sons"},"objectId":986152,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg","provenance":"- entered the Hermitage in 1920; handed over from the Shuvalov Palace Museum\n[Hermitage online database, accessed 25.09.2020](https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/38673/)","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg","restorationSurveys":[],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"none","sortingNumber":"1523-002-02","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"32.50","width":"12.50"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of a Knight and His Two Sons","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":525},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":1051},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":1576},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":731,"height":1920},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none/01_Overall/RU_ESP_GE5452_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
