A Latin inscription explains that the work was made to commemorate a burgher of Pilsen, who prior to his death in 1537 donated funds for an altar. The couple kneels in front of a low wall in adoration of the Virgin and Child, who are depicted against a green curtain held at the right by a cherub and revealing a landscape at the left. The infant child rests on a cushion in his mother¿s lap, while she offers him a bunch of grapes. The donors are shown in diminutive size either side of the inscription, wearing attire appropriate to their status. Kaspar Kaspárek and his widow (d. 1565) were buried in the Church of the Assumption in the Franciscan monastery.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 82 x 56 cm\n[Exhib. Cat.
