For the painterly execution of the wings the sculptor secured the cooperation of the best available artists. The exterior sides are decorated with scenes from the legend of Kunigunde by an unknown master. The first transition of the altar is of a good painterly quality by the workshops of the Master of the Döbelner Altarpiece and the workshop of the Master of the Oberbobritzsch Altarpiece which in terms of style and forms corresponds with that of the beginning of the Renaissance in Freiberg. Numerous artists working on the panels have brought together something of Cranach's world view, the Franconian culture of painting and forms common to Freiberg.\nThe interior reveals a central shrine by the workshop of Philipp Koch with a sculptural representation of the patron St Kunigunde and her husband Heinrich II flanked by the Virgin and Child with St Anne and the apostle Thomas. Scenes from the Passion of Christ are arranged either side of the shrine. \n[see: Sandner 1993, 140-143] (Translation, cda 2016)","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1513,"dated":"1513","end":1513,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Corpus dated on reverse]"},"description":"The painting is part of a representation that extends over two wings and depicts Christ with the 12 apostles in an interior with a view of a landscape. \nChrist and Peter stand at the centre of the group of apostles, both gesticulating energetically. One suggestion is that the scene depicts Christ taking leave of the apostles and the proclamation of Christ's suffering. Another interpretation suggests the calling of Peter. \n[http://www.kirchspiel-rochlitzer-land.de/kirchspiel/default/index.php?cat=x_ro&subcat=gebaeude&page=kuni_ausstattung; accessed 30 Mar 2016]
