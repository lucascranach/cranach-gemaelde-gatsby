Commissioned by Joachim II Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop created them for the collegial church in Berlin (Berliner Stiftskirche) between 1537 and 1538. This is one of the central panels, which was probably flanked by full-length depictions of saints on the wings and complemented by scenes from the old testament on the predella. […] The Berlin Passion cycle was based on the 16 Passion altarpieces, which were commissioned by Cardinal Albrecht from Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop for the collegial church in Halle (Hallenser Stiftskirche) (about 1520-1525) and it was the second large painted Passion series created in the Cranach workshop. Not only are numerous central panels now missing from the Berlin Passion altarpieces, like for example ‚The Arrest of Christ‘ or ‚The Crucifixion‘, but in addition the whereabouts of all the wing panels and a large number of the predella panels is unknown. They were probably lost in 1613 when Elector Johann Sigismund converted to Calvinism. […]‘ \n[Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.

The composition of this painting is determined by the contrast between the four henchmen in contemporary dress who with faces distorted by their grimaces beat Christ with a wide sweeping motion and the humiliated, suffering figure of Christ bound to the column. His slightly bent body covered in bleeding wounds and his face expressing sufferance are turned towards the viewer in an almost frontal pose, which achieves a particular immediacy. The henchmen sitting in the foreground prepares the crown of thorns later worn by Christ.\n[see Elke A. Werner, Exhib. Cat.
