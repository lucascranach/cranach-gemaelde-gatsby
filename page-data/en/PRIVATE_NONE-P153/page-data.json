The presence of lead and calcium suggests the use of lead white and calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulphate as a bullking agent. Limited amounts of zinc were also detected, but this may stem from either natural contamination or retouches. Lead-tin-yellow could not be identified. In the region of the whip both lead and antimone were detected (naples yellow?). This could also be from pigments in paint used for retouching, clearly visible under the stereomicroscope. \nThe pink tones for the flesh paint were applied over the initial grey underpaint. This underpaint also played a part in modulating areas of shadow. The x-radiograph shows that the paint was essentially applied with a broad brush without any obvious corrections during the painting process. \nAt the top left corner there is an insignia showing a serpent with dropped bird's wings, facing left. In places the light yellow paint fills the drying cracks in the dark background. The shape of the serpent does not correspond with the usual insignia found on panels from the Cranach workshop. The serpent's body is particularly broad. \nThe identified pigments were commonly used in European panel painting and also in the Cranach workshop. A comparative example for the use of a blocked in grey underpaint/ground with particularly large white pigment particles is not presently recorded in Cranach's known oeuvre. There are also considerable discrepancies between the present work and paintings securely attributed to Cranach with regards the quality of execution. The grey ground and the use of smalt suggest that the painting may have been created in the 17th or early 18th century."}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"Artist's insignia at the top left: serpent with dropped wings","sortingNumber":"1602-010","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"99.50","width":"72.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Christ as the Man of Sorrows","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":277},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":553},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":830},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4244,"height":5872},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P153_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
