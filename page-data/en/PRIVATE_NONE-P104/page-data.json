In Wittenberg about 1515 there was apparently great interest for depictions of the ascetic, pious scholar, and it may be assumed that the theological conflicts during those years were the cause.

The drawing concentrates on fixing the essential contours as well as some details.

For example the left under arm of St Jerome is slightly higher in the underdrawing and the contours of the tree trunk at the left edge were shifted slightly to the left during the painting process."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical Examination","text":"Flesh paint\nThe flesh paint was initially laid in with an admixture of lead white and vermilion pigments. The shadows were subsequently modulated with semi-transparent brown glazes and highlights were added with a lighter flesh coloured paint. The paint was applied with brushstrokes and dabbed. The x-radiograph exhibits a comparatively weak absorption and suggests an experienced painter. It may be assumed that the artist drew on a detailed pre-existing design. \nThe physiognomy of St Jerome is masterfully painted. The eyes are confidently executed, considering their size: the tiny eyeballs were executed employing an admixture of whitish blue paint, the caruncle was indicated using red paint, the black pupils were heightened with white dots of reflected light and the eyebrows and the eyelashes were applied to the dark ground with a few light grey hairline strokes. Similarly the small figure of Christ on the cross (head c. 1 cm) was painted with great confidence. \nGarments\nThe red cardinal's vestments and the broad rimmed hat were intially painted employing vermilion and black, subsequently white highlights and black shadows were added. Finally a lush red glaze was applied to the whole area. In contrast the white cloths were essentially modelled wet-in-wet with white and black pigments (possibly some coloured pigments in the folds). \nThe lion was initially painted in an unmodulated brown layer. Single hairs were then added with a pointed brush employing dark and lighter (lead-tin-yellow ?) admixtures. \nSky and landscape\nThe sky and the background landscape were intially painted with grey paint (white and black pigments). A tonal gradation between the zenith (grey) and the horizon (white) is discernable. Finally the blue pigment was dabbed on. It appears to be very finely ground azurite. The horizon was brightened with the addition of yellow (lead-tin-yellow?). \nThe landscapes in the foreground and the middle-ground were initially laid in employing a variety of unmodulated colours. Details were added employing brushes of varying widths in combination with different paint consistencies and modes of application. For example to depict the bark of the tree and the moss the paint was dabbed on with a bristled brush. In the area under the horizontal bar of the cross the texture of wood was acheived with a streaky semi-glazed application that allows the imprimatura to shine through. Employing a pointed brush the grass and foliage were finely textured and expand together with the dabbed on  leafage like a net over the ground. \nStriking in this painting is the difference in the painterly quality between the modelling of the folds in the white cloths and the red cardinal's vestments. Whereas the lighting is more nuanced in the depiction of St Jerome's white cloth  the representation of the folds of his robe are less convincing. Similarly the graphic depiction of grass and foliage is relatively schematic."}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["04_X-radiograph/PRIVATE_NONE-P104_FR-none_2008_X-radiograph.tif","04_X-radiograph/PRIVATE_NONE-P104_FR-none_2008_X-radiograph-Detail-002.tif","04_X-radiograph/PRIVATE_NONE-P104_FR-none_2008_X-radiograph-Detail-001.tif"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Ingo Sandner","role":"created by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2008","endDate":"2008"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"12.
