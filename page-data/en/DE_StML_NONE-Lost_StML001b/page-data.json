The whole complex consisted of three painted panels and a carved shrine. When closed the panel depicting the three female saints Barbara, Catherine and Dorothy was visible. It then opened out like a book to really the other two panels showing St Olav with the two evangelists John and Matthew on the left and the deposition on the right-hand side.  When opened a second time a sculptural ensemble was revealed, depicting the Holy Kinship on one side and the Sts Roche, Anthony and Sebastian on the other. These saints were flanked either side by diminutive figures of the apostles in vertical niches. \nThis panel shows Christ at the centre of the composition, being taken down from the cross by Joseph of Arimathia and Nicodemus as described in St John’s Gospel. At the left are the three Marys and St John while Mary Magdalene kneels at the right of the cross and the Virgin, beyond grief, observes from behind. The figurative group is set against a gilded background with a punched decorative pattern.\n[cda 2021]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 156 x 148 cm\nDimensions including frame: 176 x 168 cm\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 74]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":null,"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_StML_NONE-Lost_StML001b","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Hans Kemmer","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Hans Kemmer","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Bruns 1900, CXXXI] [Gaedertz 1900] [Schaeffer 1917] [Emmendörffer 1997, 42]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"'work of Cranach's youth or by an assistant' [Woermann,  Woltmann 1882]","role":"Artist","suffix":"and workshop"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":6,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Parthey 1863 - 1864] [Goldschmidt 1890, 27] [Flechsig 1900 A, 129-131]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":8,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"'niederelbisch' (anonymous artist from the lower Elb region) [Funk 1841]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Matthias Grünewald","date":"","displayOrder":10,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Matthias Grünewald","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Waagen 1846] [Kugler 1861] [Gaedertz 1887]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Pietro Perugino","date":"","displayOrder":12,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Pietro Perugino","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Zietz 1822, 66, 67] [Funk 1823]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"12937","details":[{"name":"Matthias Grünewald","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]},{"constituentId":"27380","details":[{"name":"Perugino","nameType":"Alternativer Name"},{"name":"Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci","nameType":"Alternativer Name"},{"name":"Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci Perugino","nameType":"Alternativer Name"},{"name":"Pietro Perugino","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Pietro Vannucci","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]},{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]},{"constituentId":"123883","details":[{"name":"Hans Kemmer","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on oak wood\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 74]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 156 x 148 cm\nDimensions including frame: 176 x 168 cm\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 74]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1522 - 1524","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"DE_StML_NONE-Lost_StML001b","imgSrc":"","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"St Olav Altarpiece: The Deposition [inner side, left wing]"},"objectId":1004435,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"St. Marien, Lübeck","provenance":"- the contract for the altarpiece was drawn up and signed on the 09.10.1522 and the completed work was delivered and installed in the Bergenfahrerkapelle, in St. Marien, Lübeck in March 1524 (c. one year later than originally agreed upon).\n[Bruns 1900, CXXXI]\n- the altarpiece was destroyed during the 2nd World War\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 42]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"CXXXI, 298","referenceId":"30538","title":"Bruns 1900"},{"pageNumber":"42-92","referenceId":"366","title":"Emmendörffer 1997"},{"pageNumber":"126 - 131, 135","referenceId":"398","title":"Flechsig 1900 A"},{"pageNumber":"19, 20","referenceId":"30540","title":"Funk 1823"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30541","title":"Funk 1841"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30544","title":"Gaedertz 1887"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30545","title":"Gaedertz 1900"},{"pageNumber":"27","referenceId":"30547","title":"Goldschmidt 1890"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30543","title":"Kugler 1861"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"453","title":"Parthey 1863-1864"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"1781","title":"Schaefer 1917"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30542","title":"Waagen 1846"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"1162","title":"Woltmann, Woermann 1882"},{"pageNumber":"66,67","referenceId":"30539","title":"Zietz 1822"}],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"painting not preserved","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"30.03.2021","endDate":"1997"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"30.
