[Letter W. Schade to D. Koepplin, 2012]\n\nIn 1936 the panel was cut in the Galerie Abels, Cologne, probably to make it more sellable. The fragment with the head of St John and the bowl was returned to the Museum and the piece with Salome was sold to the Galerie P. de Boer. In 1972 the Galerie P. de Boer offered it for sale this time as a Sibylle of Saxony with a light background. A comparison of the photographs from 1937 and 1972 shows that the cracquellée on the foreheads of the women corresponds. In addition paint remnants indicate that the light background was originally dark.  \n\n[Jacoby 2002, 197-212]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1549,"dated":"1549","end":1549,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"The painting shows a bust portrait of a young woman in courtly dress.
