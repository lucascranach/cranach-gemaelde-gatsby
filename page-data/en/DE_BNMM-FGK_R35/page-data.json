Of these the composition of this painting corresponds to the version in the National Gallery of Art in Washington (Inv-Nr. 1961.9.69), dated 1536 and a version in  Aschaffenburg (Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Inv-Nr. 13255), dated 1539. [...] However, the signature and date '1516' certainly do not stem from the Cranach workshop. The execution of details and the manner in which the light falling on Christ's body is represented suggest that the work was created during the so-called Dürer renaissance in the 17th century. \n[Cat.

The latter sits in contemporary dress on the back of his white horse and looks up at the crucified figure. Christ's pale body contrasts with the black background, that alludes to the darkness, which according to Lk 23, 44 prevailed during the last three hours before his death. The composition is framed by the two thieves crucified with Christ. \n[see: Cat. Kronach 2014, 268-269, No. 102]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 49.6 x 34.5 cm\n[Cat.
