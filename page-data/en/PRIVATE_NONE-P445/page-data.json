This painting depicts a toothless old man holding a young girl in his arms. He is oblivious to the fact that she attempts to steal his purse. The young woman, who is shown looking at the viewer, wears a red dress and precious jewellery. This version is probably an early copy after a version now in the fränkische Galerie, Kronach [DE_BStGS-FGK_1465].\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 79.2 x 55.5 x c. 1.3 cm\n[Unpublished examination report, H.
