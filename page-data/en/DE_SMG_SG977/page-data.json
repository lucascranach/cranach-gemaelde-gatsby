It is recorded that in 1542 by order of Johann Friedrich the 70 year old artist travelled to Wolfenbüttel to make drawings of the town. The commissioner evidently considered the subject of great importance.[…] \nThe Gotha painting, like the woodcut, was probably completed shortly after the event as the significance and demand for the subject had dwindled by 1547. \nIn comparison with the graphic version alterations and deviations suggest that the painting was created by an artist closely associated with the Cranach workshop. \n[Exhib.
