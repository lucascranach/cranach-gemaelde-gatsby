It is clearly an assemblage of a panel from the Cranach workshop and a family table by another hand. According to the date the panel was completed in 1544, while the installation of the epitaph, including the family table, was not until after Johannes Unruh had passed away. As stated in the inscription he was a councilman and mayor of Zwickau. Furthermore he was without doubt involved establishing the Lutheran reformation in Zwickau, as in 1541 he hosted Philipp Melanchthon in his home in Zwickau. […]\nThe figure of the female protagonist at the centre could be a criterion to distinguish between the numerous versions. She either offers a child to Christ or like in the Zwickau version joins her hands in an attitude of prayer. It is possible that the panels showing a female figure in prayer at the centre were intended to be used as epitaphs. This assumption is reinforced by the version in Schleswig (see CDA ID: DE_SHLM_1989-480), which in addition to the woman praying also represents a father beside his deceased son in the foreground.
