Her head is turned away to the left. She wears a fur-trimmed cloak, beneath which the puffed sleeves of a dress are visible, and her torso is exposed. She wears gloves, a pearl necklace and a linked chain. Her blonde curls peep out from beneath the net bonnet. Lucretia stands in front of a green curtain framed by Renaissance architecture.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 39.5 x 27.5 cm\nDimensions including frame: 55 x 43 x 7 cm\n[Bonnefantenmuseum,
