However in 1979 they were separated again, because their different supports and compositional inconsistencies suggested that they never belonged together. \nThe panels have since been reunited. The erroneous assumption that the support materials differed resulted from the fact that the reverse of the upper part had been reinforced with oak wood, whereas the lower part still displayed the original beech wood support.\n[cda 2019]","year":2019}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1546,"dated":"1546","end":1546,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"According to the ancient Roman story Cimon was incarcerated and sentenced to death by starvation and then breastfeed by his daughter Pero (Roman Charity).
