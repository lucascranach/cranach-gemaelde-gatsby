It is not documented when this treatment occurred. Additions, which enlarged the size of the panel, were removed in 1924 and are documented in the historical photographs and the inventory entries. The panel has been trimmed marginally on all four sides. \nThe panel exhibits a minimal amount of old woodworm damage, which is most concentrated along the left edge and the lower third of the panel and is visible at the side in the end-grain wood as well as on the reverse. \n\nPaint Layers: \n\n- the curtain in the upper right corner is a later, not documented, addition; the x-radiograph reveals the representation of a coat-of-arms, which is original (see Interpretation/History/Discussion). The panel was in a frame when the coat-of-arms was overpainted as the paint does not extend to the edge of the panel. The paint layer of the curtain exhibits strong x-ray absorption and probably contains lead white or lead tin yellow. The inventory number '333' from 1772 in the bottom right corner, which was later overpainted, is also clearly visible in the x-radiograph. \nThe colour of the batten attached to the left edge of the panel was adjusted and the paint layer slightly overlaps the original paint.  In the flesh paint there are small isolated discoloured retouches; further retouches are located along the joins. \nThere is a fine network of drying cracks predominantly in the dark paint areas. Numerous tiny roundish paint losses can be observed mainly in the flesh paint; further losses are located along the edges of the painting.  \n\n\n[Monika Strolz, Ute Tüchler, Kunsthistorisches Museum, revised 2012] \n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2012","endDate":"2012"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"01.

The dotted course of some lines results from the surface structure of the ground and is characteristic for a dry drawing material. The shadow on the right eye was indicated with sparse parallel hatching-strokes. The position of the right ear was shifted down slightly.

The fine lines of the underdawing in the face are also visible to the naked eye.    \n(see Fig. AT_KHM_GG885_FR429_2008-03-02_Photomicrograph-M6x-009)"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The flesh paint was laid in at an early stage of the painting process, followed by the execution of the clothes. Then the figure was overlapped with the paint from the background. This is visible in the x-radiograph in the form of bold brushstrokes which frame the figure. Details like the fringed contour of the beret and the collar were painted over the background. \nIn some places there is an alternating and marginal overlap of the figure and the background and there are additional minor corrections to the contours.   The cast-shadow was held in reserve when the background was painted and then executed with a thin paint application of streaky brushstrokes. The transition to the background paint was blended by painting wet-in-wet. \nThe x-radiograph shows that the flesh paint in the area of the forehead is more generously laid in and was subsequently covered by the black paint of the beret. The modelling followed with prominent highlights containing lead white. In the flesh paint it is apparent, that his coloring with the reddish, pink areas is substantially warmer than that of the female pendant (AT_KHM_GG886_FR430). Highlights and modelling were applied not only in white but also in a cool pink tone, shadows followed in brown and red tones. The paint application of the pattern on the handkerchief was executed wet-in-wet, likewise the hair of the beard was applied over the wet paint of the lace collar. The white of the lace cuffs was applied in an impasto manner over the black and partially blended with a dry brush while still wet. \nA particular feature can be observed in the area of the hands where a dark line runs along the back of the hand. This line appears to be drawn less as a final contour, but rather as an indication of the extent to which the flesh paint should be covered by the background paint. (see fig.
