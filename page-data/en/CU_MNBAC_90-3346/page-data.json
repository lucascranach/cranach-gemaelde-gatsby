Very fine red pigment particles. Identified as an admixture of red iron oxide with a small percentage of siliceous material (red ochre) and small amounts of vermilion. The layer is bound mainly in oil. The small quantity of binding medium present prevents a more precise conclusion.\nVarnish: yellow coloured brittle layer. The varnish exhibits a strong white fluorescence in UV light. Analysis with IR-spectroscopy identified a natural resin on the basis of triterpenoids like dammar or mastix\nSample 1b:\nWhite: compact pure white ground layer. On the underside of the cross-section remnants of a yellowish transparent binding medium are visible. The layer is impregnated with a yellowish transparent medium, with a clearly evident concentration of medium at the surface.\nCalcium carbonate bound in a medium containing protein, glue. The concentration of medium both at the top and bottom were also identified as glue \nBlack: islands of a very thin black layer. The cross-section shows two paint layers: a greyish-black rather diffuse admixture over a thin red layer. Red ochre, small quantities of vermilion as well as fine particles of carbon black pigment were identified, bound in an essentially oil medium (the exact relation of the medium could not be established.)\n[Report, Elizabeth Jägers, Erhard Jägers, 25.04.2001]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Gunnar Heydenreich","role":"written by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"04.07.2001","endDate":"04.07.2001"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"02.
