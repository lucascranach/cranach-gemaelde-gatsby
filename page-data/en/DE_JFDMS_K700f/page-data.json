Whereas Christ's cross occupies the vertical central axis of the painting, the thieves' crosses are positioned diagonally in the pictorial space. The long tails of Christ's loincloth waft out on either side, connecting with both thieves. Christ's head, decorated with the crown of thorns and a halo, has dropped to the left, his eyes are closed in contrast with those of the thieves. \n\n[Görres, cda 2013]","dimensions":"Dimension of
