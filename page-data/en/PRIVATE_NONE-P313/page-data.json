There is no evidence of lead-tin-yellow. The red draperies were executed with red and black pigments without a black underpaint. \n\nPatterns and highlights were painted on the draperies, coins, purse, bonnet and pearls in shell gold.\n\nAnother composition or correction to the present one were not visible in the x-radiograph. \n\nThe paint layer structure is different from other verified Cranach paintings. For example the red draperies were not underpainted with black. The identified pigments were used in the Cranach workshop and more generally in 16th century European panel painting north of the Alps and later. The lack of lead-tin-yellow in yellow areas and the use of shell gold e. g. in the slits of the red robe is atypical. It is certain that the author of this painting was not familiar with standard practice in Cranach's Wittenberg workshop. \n\n[unpublished examination report, G.
