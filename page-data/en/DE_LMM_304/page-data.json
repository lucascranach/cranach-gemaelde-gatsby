Areas of flesh were initially blocked in with tempera applied in fine brushstrokes and then drawn together and modulated with an oil/resin glaze (?); shadows were then added on top with resin, highlights were also added in this manner; for the hat the paint was stippled and modulated with a brush to simulate a flat surface and create shadows. \nThe coat with the fur collar (?) is not well preserved, the folds lack shadows and the modulation appears considerably abraded. We can only assume that glazes and highlights were applied to this underpaint.. Rings on the fingers: calligraphic aplication over a glazed underlayer, yellow (safflor) to imitate gold highlights was added employing a water-based paint . The paint extends to the barbe, at the top some resinous green paint has squeezed through. \nThe dark green curtain in the background raised some questions as it is not typical for the period and subject. The question of later overpaint was also discussed as in other areas of the painting a uniform dark green background (see hands) was evident. An examination in UV-light showed an even and uniform fluorescence and an intact aged surface peppered with retouches.
