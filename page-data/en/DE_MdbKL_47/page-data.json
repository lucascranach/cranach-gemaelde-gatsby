The woodworm damage was treated with hylotox\n- the panel exhibits a slight convex warp \n\n\nGround/ Paint Layers: \n\n- vertical woodworm channels are visible as imprints on the surface.They have been filled and retouched, but in places they have created hollow areas beneath the ground.   \n- the paint layers exhibit a very fine network of pronounced aging cracks (see condition report from 27.03.1972 by Ingrid Käppler/ conservator)\n- numerous small losses caused by woodworm damage and damage at the edges. Abrasion in the thin paint layers like for example in the landscape and generally in the glazes. Partial abrasion along the edges of the cracquelée. Small and very tiny losses along the edges in areas where the support is damaged (woodworm damage, exposed ground)\n- extensively retouched in the sky and in Christ's red robe. Overpaint in the sky and on the red robe. Occasional overpaint in the flesh paint, like the feet, Christ's legs, the donor on the left, the girl kneeling at the bottom on the right as well as the eldest girl on the left and the woman behind (cheeks and shadows). Extensive retouching in the fur collar, retouches have discoloured. \n- in part the green glaze in the landscape depiction has become brown \n\n\nVarnish:\n- the varnish is not original. Application consisting of numerous layers. At the edges and in the green areas remnants of an older, original varnish. The painting was partially cleaned in the flesh paint and the sky and white areas. (At least one partial cleaning was carried out while the painting was still fitted in its frame.) Differing gloss due to the damage caused by worm channels. In the sky patchy, yellowed with drip marks. The varnish is streaky and in the dark areas cloudy (black). The last varnish removal was probably carried out by Philipp Ritter in 1900. The last application of varnish was in 1972 (dammar-beeswax, 1:7 in oil of terpentine) \n\n[Museum der bildenden Künste, 11.06.2014]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"11.06.2014","endDate":"11.06.2014"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"20.

Initial application after the underdrawing: \ngrey to greyish-brown washes, the flesh paint and white areas were held in reserve, e. g. the sarcophagus, the garments where light \n2. Sky: \nthe underpaint was executed with dark grey paint becoming lighter further up. Subsequently a light yellow admixture of opaque to semi-opaque paint was applied and red was blended wet-in-wet. The dark grey at the top edge is a single paint layer (see underpaint). Over this a red tone was applied wet-in-wet. The highlights in the clouds are impasto. \n3. Garments, Armour:\nwith the exception of the white garments and the fur collar an opaque, relatively thick paint application was employed, subsequently the highlights were applied wet-in-wet, and details in impasto. The white garments were laid in with lead white. The folds were modeled with grey glazes and blackish-grey tones. Highlights were applied with thick impasto employing lead white , other details were added using opaque black paint. \n4. Landscape: \ninitially laid in with grey to greyish-brown washes. Vegetation in part unmodulated underpaint in light green admixtures, opaque to semi-transparent, but also occasional luminous green washes. subsequently the shapes of leaves (contours), grass and branches were added employing light yellow, yellowish-green or brown admixtures (frequently impasto). Over these in part green glazes. \n5. Flesh paint: \nthe shadows were laid in with a grey wash, finely dabbed on or blended. for the highlights the ground was left exposed (without a distinct boader to the shadows) and the transition to the greyish-brown admixture of the hair is fluid (the hair was laid in wet-in-wet with semi-opaque brown tones). After the drying process the flesh tones were applied. In the lighter areas these were applied as an opaque layer and blended very soft, over the grey underpaint a semi-opaque application was employed, allowing the underpaint to shine through. The red for the cheeks and light highlights were blended wet-in-wet. The deeper shadows in the flesh paint and the hair were thinly applied with blackish-brown glazes and delicately dabbed and blended. Finally delicate fine highlights, contours and the tips of the hair were added. \n- in all flesh paint glazed to semi-opaque application, blended with no brushstrokes visible. Very delicately dabbed aplication in the shadows. In parts of the landscape, the fur and the hair semi-opaque brown tones. Highlights like for example in the armour and the white garments opaque to impasto application. Also in impasto: all the light contours, the ornamentation, the strands of hair and the highlights. Large colour flieds were painted with a broad brush, for example the edge of the sarcophagus or the different painted sections of the sky, where faint brushstrokes are visible. \n- in the flesh paint thin to very thin application otherwise the consistency is relatively opaque and in part very thick like in the sky. The paint application in the fur and hair of the sitters is glazed to semi-opaque. The red glazes have faded, e. g. the fur of the two boys on the left. A broad animal-hair brush probably employed for the sky and the garments. Very small, short pointed brushes were used for the fur, the hair and the vegetation. Larger, softer animal-hair brushes were used to blend the paint. \n- the paint was brushed out along the right edge of the panel, see photomicrograph \n- the green glaze has turned brown.
