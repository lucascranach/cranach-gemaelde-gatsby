[3] Through the metaphor of the hunt, which represents an allergory for sovereign virtues, a positive light was cast on the difficult relationship in terms of foreign policy between Charles V and Johann Friedrich. This relationship was at once informed by unity in the fight against the Turks and conflicting interests regarding the question of reformation. [4] The hunting scene may have been a diplomatic gift - perhaps even to the emperor himself. [5] \n[1] Exhib. Cat. Dresden 2004, 158, No. 218\n[2] Among others: Francis 1959, 202-205\n[3] Exhib. Cat.

This work is signed with the monogram of Lucas Cranach and dated 1544. It was brought to Spain by Maria of Hungary and hung in the El Prado Palace, where it is listed in the inventory of 1564.\n\nLucas Cranach and his workshop painted various scenes similar to this one. Each of them shows the elector of Saxony in possession of Torgau Castle, accompanied by different rulers of that time.\n\nThose paintings, which may have been commissioned by Elector Johann Friedrich as presents to other princes during the fifteen forties, have a political meaning. On one hand, they depict him as the legitimate Lord of his territory, with a commitment to the Reformation, as Torgau was the first Protestant church built ex-novo. At the same time, hunting was synonymous with good government at that time, and it alludes to the necessary collaboration among rulers in order to insure peace.\n\n[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/a-hunt-in-honor-of-carlos-v-at-torgau-castle/](accessed 10.09.2012)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 114 cm x 175 cm\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","exhibitionHistory":"Gotha/Kassel 2015, No. 74 (only in Kassel)","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1280,"height":842}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":132},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411_2015_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":263},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411_2015_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":395},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411_2015_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1280,"height":842},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411_2015_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P02175_FR411_2015_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"ES_MNdP_P02175","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Exhib.
