Sandner, Spätgotische Tafelmalerei in Sachsen, Dresden/Basel 1993, pp. 174, 178, reproduced plates 40 a & b). By the same hand is a panel of curious arched form comparable to the present one, but without the central indentation, depicting The Martyrdom of Saint James, and also in the Schlosskirche, Chemnitz, as well as two further similar panels, depicting The Virgin in Heaven with Saints and The Trinity, in the same church, which could well be by thw same hand. The figure of God the Father in the latter panel is strikingly similar to the one in the present panel. Sandner considers the first three to be the work of an independent pupil of Cranach, circa 1515.  Meyer agrees with the dating, but thinks it unlikely that this anonymous Cranach follower could have been an independent Master at this early date.\n\n[cda 2019]","year":2019}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1510,"dated":"about 1515","end":1520,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2005/old-master-paintings-evening-sale-l05033/lot.29.html?locale=en; accessed 08-03-2019]"},"description":"This picture may have been painted as part of a cycle.
