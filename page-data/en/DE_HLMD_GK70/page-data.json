The child holds an apple in his right hand, while more are visible in the top right corner hanging from the tree. The Virgin's hair is covered by a transparent veil and the slight inclination of her head betrays her motherly affection. At the right edge of the image an expansive landscape is visible with a castle on a rocky outcrop. \n[cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 85 x 58 x 1.2 cm\nDimensions including frame: 103.5 x 76 x 7.5 cm\n[Cat.
