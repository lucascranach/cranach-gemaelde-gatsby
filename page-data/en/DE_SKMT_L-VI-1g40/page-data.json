It is documented that when the altar was closed St Nicholas adorned the exterior on the right hand side. On the left wing he was counterbalanced by a pope (perhaps St Gregory). When the altarpiece was open a depiction of St Sebastian was visible on the left wing and St Roche on the right (the reverse of St Nicholas). These saints, who were invoked against the plague, flanked the central panel showing St Jerome being tempted by the devil. His wife pours water over the naked saint who is covered in bruises, while he gives some money to three musicians.\n \n[Koepplin 2009, 12-16, 33]","year":2009}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1515,"dated":"about 1515","end":1515,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1515","end":"1520","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, 92, No. 110D]","text":"about 1518-1520"}],"remarks":"[Koepplin 2009, 7]"},"description":"This close-up representation of the saint shows him facing left against a blue background.
