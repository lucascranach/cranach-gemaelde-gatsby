Guido’s text also provides other specific details adopted by Cranach: the setting in the “loneliest part of these groves” of Mount Ida, the horse tied near a tree, and the proviso that the goddesses present themselves naked so that Paris might “consider the individual qualities of their bodies for a true judgment.”[6]\nCranach’s depiction of the theme was also influenced by early prints. An engraving of about 1460 by the Master of the Banderoles shows the three naked goddesses, modestly covering themselves with diaphanous veils, and Mercury attempting to awaken a slumbering Paris in a lush wooded landscape (fig. 47).[7] A woodcut illustration of the scene in the 1502 Wittenberg edition of Dares Phrygius’s Bellum Troianum (Trojan War)[8] also provided a visual precedent for Cranach’s first image on the theme, a signed and dated woodcut of 1508 in which the goddesses have just disrobed (fig. 48). For the contrasting front and back poses of two of them, the artist was inspired by Jacopo de’ Barbari’s Victory and Fame, an engraving of 1498 – 1500 that circulated in Nuremberg, where de’ Barbari went in 1500 to work for Emperor Maximilian I.[9] Cranach’s woodcut in turn served as the model for at least a dozen painted versions by himself and his workshop, beginning with the artist’s panel of about 1510 (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth) and including the present work, a considerably later adaptation of about 1528. […]\nA free sketch of the composition, dated by most scholars between 1527 and 1530 (fig. 49),[10] probably served as a preliminary idea for the Museum’s painting and other close variants,[11] none of which follow the initial design exactly but simply rearrange its landscape and figural motifs. Although the three goddesses have sometimes been thought to be portraits of women at the Saxon court, [12] their faces appear too generalized for such an assertion.\nInstead, they are likely based on oil sketches such as the Study of Three Female Heads of about 1530 (fig. 50), which Cranach produced for use in a number of his paintings, making slight adjustments to the facial features in each work to give the impression of different individuals.[13]\nThe remnants of Cranach’s insignia, a winged serpent, appear below the feet of the leftmost goddess, but Richard Förster failed to notice them when he stated in 1899 that the painting was neither signed nor dated.[14] The same year, Karl Woermann listed it among unauthenticated works by Cranach and his workshop,[15] and Max J. Friedländer deemed it a middling, perhaps autograph work. Others, including Eduard Flechsig, assigned it to Cranach’s son Hans.[16]\nAfter the painting was exhibited in Nuremberg in 1922 – 24 and came up for auction in 1928, Friedländer viewed it more positively as a genuine and accomplished work.[17] As a result, the Metropolitan Museum acquired the painting, and Harry Wehle published the first substantial study of the picture since Förster’s initial article.[18] Wehle convincingly argued for a date around 1528, comparing the work favorably with the version of that date in the Kunstmuseum Basel.[19] Confusion developed when Friedländer and Jakob Rosenberg (later followed by Charles Kuhn and Hans Posse) wrote that the painting is signed and dated 1529, an error corrected in the second edition of their monograph.[20] More recently, Burton Dunbar noted that the poses and attitudes of the goddesses here served as a source for the figures in The Three Graces (Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City), which is dated 1535.[21] He argued that the goddess pointing upward in that work must derive from the earlier Metropolitan’s Venus, since without Cupid above there is no iconographic reason for this gesture.\nOne of the most intriguing questions concerning Cranach’s Judgment of Paris is its deeper meaning in the context of its own time. The theme was popular with German humanists,[22] and Franz Matsche has argued for a humanist understanding of Paris’s dilemma in the vein of the philosophy of life of Conrad Celtis and his followers.[23] This concerned the difficult choice of which type of life to lead: the vita contemplativa, the vita activa, or the vita voluptaria. Although the contemplative life was the most highly regarded, its arduousness was acknowledged, as was the fact that knowledge is achieved primarily through making errors. \nHanne Kolind Poulsen viewed Matsche’s interpretation in the light of Protestantism, arguing that the Christian’s difficulty in choosing a way of life, in finding salvation, ultimately depends on divine grace.[24] This dilemma was the subject of the commencement speech given by the Greek scholar Nicolaus Marschalk to the first graduating class of the University of Wittenberg in 1503.[25] Railing against Paris’s misguided judgment, Marschalk urged students to be wary of Venus’s power and of women in general and instead to follow Minerva, who “offers thrift, a sense of shame, modesty, chastity, [and] industry . . . the stepping stones to the attainment of learning, of wisdom and the remaining virtues, and of the highest happiness.”[26] Just one year after Marschalk’s oration, a student of his at Wittenberg, Hermann Trebelius, published a warning against Venus’s power in a preface to a poem on the Judgment of Paris by the Neapolitan humanist Johannes Baptista Cantalicius.[27] The rather crude woodcut illustrating this publication was an important antecedent to Cranach’s first woodcut of the subject in 1508. Seen in this context, Cranach’s woodcut and his paintings on the theme would have an admonitory function, warning against the wiles of woman, a subject further developed in contemporary Weibermacht (power of women) images, such as Cranach’s Samson and Delilah (cat. 12). Dieter Koepplin argued that Marschalk’s moralizing interpretation, based on the writings of Fulgentius, would have been the source for Cranach’s realization of the story.[28]\nA challenge to the humanist interpretation was offered by Berthold Hinz.[29] Hinz argued that, for such an interpretation to be valid, the goddesses would have to be clearly identifiable in order to link them with the alternative ways of life, a precondition that does not apply to Cranach’s depiction. Instead, Hinz regarded the similarity of the goddesses as an attempt to “provoke a play of ideas and meanings”[30] — and perhaps to introduce an element of ambiguity and the possibility of multiple interpretations — which has little to do with the rigorous humanism found in images by contemporary artists such as Dürer and Burgkmair.[31]\nThe Judgment of Paris theme may also be understood in a social-historical rather than philosophical context. Inge El-Himoud-Sperlich has interpreted Cranach’s Paris paintings as decorations for bedroom chambers, noting that he is documented as having painted such a scene for the bridal chamber of Margareta von Anhalt, who married Duke Johann of Saxony in 1513. El-Himoud-Sperlich suggested that these works were meant not as warnings to men against making wrong decisions, as Koepplin theorized, but instead as confirmations for women that their husbands had renounced what advantages might be gained by marrying a smarter (Minerva) or wealthier (Juno) mate, instead choosing for love and beauty (Venus).[32]\nKoepplin, in a more recent revisiting of the Judgment of Paris theme, examined a few troubling issues, namely, Cupid’s pointing his arrow at Venus instead of at Paris and the nearly indistinguishable appearance of the goddesses. Regarding the former, Koepplin claimed that the positioning of Cupid emphasizes the power of the goddess instead of the weakness of Paris and that the informed viewer would realize that his arrow ultimately reaches Paris.[33] As for the sameness of the goddesses, Koepplin noted that, althougha moralizing message is certainly present, their resemblance serves Cranach’s desire to introduce new possibilities of meaning, such as the positive aspects of Venus’s power if the painting were to be used as a marriage picture.[34]\nEqually interesting but also controversial was Helmut Nickel’s interpretation of the Museum’s Judgment of Paris as alchemical in meaning.[35] Nickel understood the painting as representing the three stages of the so-called Great Work, that is, the conversion of base material into gold, and the three goddesses as personifications of the stages. His extremely meticulous argument has yet to be supported or refuted by other scholars on the basis of subsequent discussions of alchemy.\nClearly, there is a rich array of possible meanings for the Judgment of Paris theme. Its popularity, evidenced by the significant number of surviving examples, perhaps attests to multivalent interpretations in Cranach’s own time. \n \n[1] Frazer 1966.

New York 2013, 54, No. 11]"},"description":"Among the most popular mythological scenes produced by Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop were those featuring Venus and, in particular, the Judgment of Paris.[1] This legend relates how the goddess of discord Eris, peeved at not having been invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, attended unannounced and threw her golden apple, inscribed 'to the fairest' into the midst of the guests. Juno, Venus, and Minerva all claimed ownership of the prize, and Jupiter decreed that their dispute could be settled only by Paris, son of the king of Troy. After Mercury brought the goddesses to the Trojan prince, each offered him a bribe: Juno, power; Minerva, all human knowledge; and Venus, the love of Helen of Troy, wife of the Spartan king, Menelaus, and the world's most beautiful woman. Paris chose Venus and embarked for Sparta to abduct Helen and bring her to Troy, thus instigating the Trojan War. [...]\nIn the Museum's painting, Paris has dismounted his horse and fallen asleep beneath a tree. Mercury nudges him awake with his staff, and Paris, in a sleepy stupor, observes the three beauties before him. He wears a full suit of knightly armor in the style of 1520 - 1525, including a lance rest; his sword is by his side and he holds a decoratively embellished gold war hammer. His long coat and puffed, slashed sleeves reflect contemporary courtly fashion; his huge beret with ostrich feather pom-poms, a type worn by high-ranking military commanders, perhaps was introduced here to appeal to the patron.[2] Mercury's costume, including the breastplate with oak leaf decoration, the fringed red skirt beneath, and the extraordinary hat showing two birds ravenously eating seeds from a pod,\nis pure fantasy.[3] The apple he holds appears to be formed of rock crystal. The three goddesses are only very slightly differentiated, perhaps to emphasize the difficulty of Paris's decision.[4] Which is Juno and which Minerva is unclear,[5] but the center figure must be Venus. It is she who is the most suggestively alluring, with her broad-brimmed, feather-adorned red hat and strategically placed diaphanous veil that accentuates all the more her otherwise naked state. It is also she who points to Cupid, who in turn prepares to shoot his arrow at her. The walled-in city in the background being approached by a large ship is presumably Troy, and the leaf less, dead branches on the tree directly above the figures may signal the destruction to come.\n\n[1] Some nineteenth-century scholars thought the subject of this painting was the Anglo-Saxon legend of the knight Albonack presenting his daughters to King Alfred III of Mercia. For this legend, see M. Rosenberg 1930, pp. 91-96. R. Förster (1899, pp. 265; 73, pl. 10) refuted this interpretation for the Museum's painting.\n[2] My thanks to Dirk H. Breiding, Assistant Curator, Department of Arms and Armor, MMA, for discussing with me the details of the armor worn by Paris and Mercury.\n[3]Inge El-Himoud-Sperlich (1977, pp. 54-55) claimed that Mercury wears the fantastic clothing of a herald in contemporary theater; it has been noted (in Metropolitan Museum 1987, p. 109) that Mercury's dress is 'appropriate to the Nordic messenger god Wotan [sic].'\n[4] Bodo Brinkmann noted this in relation to the Kimbell Art Museum version (Brinkmann in Frankfurt and London 2007/2008, p. 326, no. 101).\n[5] R. Förster (1899, p. 272) claimed that the goddess at the left is Juno, because she appears 'somewhat more mature and restrained than the others' while the one at the right is Minerva, who chastely turns away from the viewer. Biedermann also identified the goddess with the hat as Venus in the closely related drawing in Braunschweig (fig. 49; Biedermann 1981, p. 312, fig. 7).\n\n[Cat.

A gray underpaint was used for the greenery of the landscape. Other hallmarks of Cranach’s technique include hair worked up from a nearly flat orange-brown, finished with delicate whorls of yellow, orange, and brown brushstrokes.\nPainted “countercurls” can be seen in the hair of two of the goddesses, a mannerism associated with the finest paintings produced by Cranach and his workshop.[1]\n \n[1] Verbal communication, Gunnar Heydenreich, July 2011."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"Not original\n[Cat.
