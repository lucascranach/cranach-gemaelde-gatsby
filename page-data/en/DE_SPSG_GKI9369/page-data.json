For example the Erasmus-Maurice-panel (Munich, Alte Pinakothek) created by Grünewald for the collegial church in Halle (Hallenser Stiftskirche) about 1520-1524. […]\nLikewise the pendant picture depicting St Ursula could be a role portrait. The letters O.M.V.I.A on Ursula’s neckband, referring to ‘Omnia vincit amor’ (Love vanquishes all) in Virgil’s 10 Eclogue, support the thesis, that it could be a crypto-portrait of a concubine (Leys Schütz?). Erotic connotations are also suggested by the direct eye contact between the two figures and the alignment of the arrow, which like Cupid’s arrow is pointing at Erasmus/Albrecht. […]\nThe present presentation of both panels as a diptych is probably not authentic. Originally they would have been wing panels of an altarpiece of which the central panel is now lost.’ \n[Elke A.

He is dressed in a sumptuous pontifical robe decorated with pearls and precious stones, which bears Albrecht's coat-of-arms, with the coats-of-arms of the dioceses of Mainz, Magdeburg and Halberstadt at the bottom. He stands in front of a green velvet curtain held by angels. He holds a crosier in his right hand, and in his left hand he holds the wooden winch with which his intestines were pulled from his body as a reference to his martyrdom.  \n[see Elke A.
