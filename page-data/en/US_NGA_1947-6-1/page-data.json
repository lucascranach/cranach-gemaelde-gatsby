The regal costume accord well with that found in other of Cranach’s portraits of Saxon nobility. The crown worn by the boy is a traditional sign of engagement [2]. The girl is probably the boy's sister, as the absence of a garland on her head makes it unlikely that she is his fiancée. The betrothal of noble children was not uncommon; Talbot called attention to Berhard Strigel’s portrait of Ludwig of Hungary (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), aged nine and wearing a crown, painted in 1515 on the occasion of a double engagement of Ludwig and his sister to a daughter and son of Philip the Fair [3]. In addition, Cranach’s portrait dated 1529 of a young boy wearing a betrothal crown (FR329) is tentatively identified as a prince of Saxony [4]. \nThere have been two attempts to identify the children in the National Gallery portraits. Friedländer and Rosenberg thought they were possibly the children of Duke George the Bearded of Saxony: Prince Friedrich, born in 1504, and Princess Christine, born in 1505 [5]. Werl suggested that they might be Count Philipp of Hesse and duchess Elizabeth of Saxony, but Koepplin, the only author to comment, did not find this proposal convincing [6]. Neither identification can be verified. While it is often difficult to guess the ages of children in portraits, it seems to the author that the girl is several years older than her brother, which argues against the identification put forward by Friedländer and Rosenberg.\nFollowing Friedländer and Rosenberg, most authors agree in dating the portraits to the period around 1516/1518. Ruhmer thought they might be later but declined specific comments, while Werl would like to date them around 1512, primarily because Elizabeth of Saxony was born in 1502 [7].\nAs noted by Talbot, however, there are stylistic comparisons with the pair of portraits of Maurice Buchner, dated 1518, and his wife Anna (US_MIA_57-11_FR127, US_MIA_57-10_FR128), and further, the National Gallery’s paintings are not as patterned and as severe as the 'Portrait of a Young Girl' [in Paris] usually dated around 1520 (FR153) [8].'\n \n[1] [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, Nos. 104, 105]\n[2] Compare, for example, Cranach’s portraits of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous and Sibyl of Cleve, both dated 1526 (DE_KSW_G11_FR304, DE_KSW_G12_FR305). Both persons wear crowns; the betrothal took place in September 1526 and the wedding in June of the following year.

In the expressions of the boy and girl the artist has captured the wistful innocence and gentle seriousness of childhood.

His sleeves are a lustrous red damask and appear through the armholes of his brown outer robe.

[...]\nBesides the panel on which the original painting was applied, there are additional borders attached to the left and right edges which are approximately 1 cm. wide. These are retouched to match the surrounding paint. On the reverse of the painting a cradle has been applied; it consists of five fixed vertical members and four sliding horizontal members. The wood on the cradle and the reverse of the painting are painted over with a paint which is absolutely opaque to x-rays; it is possible that this is a lead paint. Because of the presence of this coating, the x-radiographs show no image. [...] \n\nThe support appears stable but the inability to see into the structure of the panel with x-rays makes it impossible to know if there is any obvious weakness in the panel.\nThe paint layer is in reasonably good condition. The majority of the retouching can be clearly seen by viewing the painting under u. v. light. There is a good deal of thinness in the face and in the areas of the shadow beneath the chin. The contour lines around the face have been strengthened. There is a tiny loss at the left top of the head. The shadows in the cape have been re-enforced.\n\nThere is a very fine network of cracks running primarily in the vertical direction corresponding to the orientation of the wood grain.\n\nThe varnish is a relatively thick layer of natural resin - its greenish fluorescence under ultraviolet light indicates this type of resin. [...]\nThe varnish is milky and has become somewhat opaque, particularly in the background. The effect is to make the background appear absolutely flat.\n\n[Examination report, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1989]\nSee also attached pdf [forthcoming]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"18.04.1989","endDate":"21.04.1989"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"17.

Fischer","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"This summarized report should be viewed in conjunction with the report from 1989.\n\nThe cradle has six fixed vertical members and four moveable horizontal bars. The horizontal bar at the bottom of the piece does not move, and is probably held in place with paint. The entire back of the painting and cradle is painted first with a metallic layer, possibly a moisture barrier, and then a black layer over top of that. The panel is approximately a quarter of an inch thick and has been visibly planed down. Woodworm channels are visible on the back of the panel.\nThe paint layer appears to be in decent condition regarding the figure. The background is visually obscured and it is difficult to tell what condition it may be in.  There is a distinct ridge to the prince's left between his hair and the black background. The background appears a milkier, slightly lighter, more opaque black than the more greenish hue seen between the painted strands of hair. It is possible that the background is overpainted or covered by a pigmented varnish. The varnish is very thick in this area, and there are deep cracks throughout which do not follow the grain of the wood and look like traction cracks, but appear to only be in the varnish layer. The black background fluoresces darker in ultraviolet (UV) light than the greenish tint of the sitter. The background fluorescence matches the retouching in a crack down the right side of the sitter's face. The strange background appearance may be an indication of problems regarding the paint film, such as abrasion.\nThe overall appearance of the varnish is a cloudy wiped surface with some glossy spots scattered throughout. It is also very thick and under microscopic examination appears to be slightly reticulated. It is possible that there are multiple varnish layers due to the difference in fluorescence between the portrait and the background.\n\nTreatment Recommendations:\n- sampling and analysis to aid treatment and understanding in background black area\n- remove discoloured and disfiguring varnish and inpainting \n- consolidation of loose paint\n- check structural condition of panel\n- apply isolating varnish, inpaint losses, apply final varnish \n\n[Examination Report and Treatment Proposal, National Gallery of Art, Washington 2005]\nSee also attached pdf [forthcoming]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"03.11.2005","endDate":"03.11.2005"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"17.
