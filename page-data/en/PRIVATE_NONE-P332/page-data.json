In this tradition, the woman is presented as a dangerous creature, a source of sin and humiliation. This particular version depicts the couple alone, in three-quarter length, against a plain background that gives no indication of where the action is taking place. Here untypically the old man is shown on the right, whereas the woman who has beguiled him is shown on the left and willingly takes the gold coins he offers her. \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions

Folds have been laid in with a pale vermillion red tone and modulated with darker tones, with admixtures with black as well as red lake glazes. The shadow tones in the red robe and the flesh paint were applied in strokes with a fine tipped brush. There is a brown painted boarder of c. 0.2 – 1 cm width along all four edges.  \n\n\nInterpretation and evaluation: \n\nThe identified pigments frequently used in the Cranach workshop and other workshops from the middle ages to the early modern period. The identification of lead tin yellow I implies that the painting was created before 1750 or after 1940. The ground and paint application as well as stylistic characteristics differ from works attributed to the Cranach workshop. The serpent insignia at the top edge is different in shape to that of the Cranach workshop. This panel was probably not created in the Cranach workshop. \n\n[unpublished examination report, Blumenroth, Dietz, Heydenreich 29.07.2019]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"Artist's insignia at the top right: serpent without wings; in yellow paint","sortingNumber":"1600-000-24","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"34.40","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"An Ill-matched Pair","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":253},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none_2019_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":505},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none_2019_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":758},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none_2019_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4720,"height":5960},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none_2019_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P332_FR-none_2019_Overall-001.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
