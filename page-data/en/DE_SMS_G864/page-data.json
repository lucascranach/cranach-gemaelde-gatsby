In comparison with the woodcut the sleeves and position of the hand have been simplified and the body exhibits a more decisive turn. In 1575 Cranach was commissioned by Elector August of Saxony to paint another full-length figure of Luther (also without marbling effect) for the Castle of Annaburg (Schloss Annaburg) (Kunstsammlung der Veste Coburg), which shows the reformer facing to the right. […]\nThe painting in Schwerin has been conclusively attributed to Lucas Cranach the Younger since Friedländer, Rosenberg (1932) […]\nHowever the portrait of Luther may have arrived in Mecklenburg while Duke Heinrich the Peaceful was still alive. He was partisan towards the reformation at an early stage. He was related by marriage to Johann the Steadfast and as such was Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony's uncle. But Johann Albrecht I. of Mecklenburg, Heinrich's nephew, also ordered portraits of Luther and Melanchton from Cranach in 1555 - probably half-length figures. \nA copy of the painting in Schwerin was created for the church in Rehna in the second half of the 19th century (Schlie II, 442, Fig. p. 435). Further full-length figures of Luther, like that in the village Mecklenburg or in the Schelfkirche in Schwerin (now in the cathedral) appear to borrow from the woodcut. \n\n[Cat.
