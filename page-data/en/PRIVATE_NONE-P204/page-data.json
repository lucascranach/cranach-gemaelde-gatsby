The naked infant stands on a velvet cushion and is gently supported by his mother. She has inclined her head and looks with affection at her son, while offering him cherries and pea pods on a plate. She wears a plain mantle over her simple robe, and her hair is loosely bound at the nape of the neck. In the background on the right the characteristic castle is perched on top of a promontory. \n[cda 2021]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 57 x 33 cm\n[Exhib. Cat.
