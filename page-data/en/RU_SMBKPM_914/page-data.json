His red robe is striking, showing numerous slits on the sleeves and chest that are separated by light green bands with organic decorative elements.  Two neckbands complement the elaborate decoration on the collar of his shirt.  Three rings hang from one of the bands. Whereas his hair is concealed beneath a golden bonnet, his reddish beard stands out prominently. \n[Görres, cda 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 57.2 x 38.7 cm\n[Exhib. Cat.
