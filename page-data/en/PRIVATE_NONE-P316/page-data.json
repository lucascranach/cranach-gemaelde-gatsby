The splashes of paint in the background and the numerous painted strands of hair and fur that transverse the craquelée are also unusual for the 16th century. It is also surprising that the green glaze in the background was partially applied over sections of abraded paint. The ageing cracks were probably produced artificially.","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2019","endDate":""},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"28.
