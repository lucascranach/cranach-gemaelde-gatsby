The splendour of the electoral prince's attire can hardly be surpassed. Around his neck he wears a multi-rowed chain with a pendant in the shape of a dolphin. On his chest his robe is decorated with bands set with precious stones forming the letter 'S'. The index finger of his right hand is embellished with a heavy signet ring. His soft velvet hat is crowned with a plaited wreath. \n[Görres, cda 2014]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 62.8 x 39.7 cm\n[Christie's online database:
