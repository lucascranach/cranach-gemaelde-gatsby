The saint is attended by his squire and three mounted soldiers, all of whom wear plumed helmets with their visors raised. A monogram with the initials 'M.I.' surmounted by a crown appears on all of the horse brasses and on Saint George's chapeau. It is even more prominently displayed on the leading retainer's shoulder and on the arm of the squire. This repeated device, together with the unusual presence of the squire, who rarely appears in representations of this event from the saint's life, suggest that the artist intended this particular George to be identifiable.' It has been suggested that it may represent Maximillian I idealised as St George.\n[Christie's Sales Catalogue, Sale 2819, Renaissance, 29 January 2014, New York, Rockefeller Plaza]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 48 x 45.3 cm\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/old-masters-day-sale-l16037/lot.117.html; accessed 30.03.2020]","exhibitionHistory":"London 1979, no. 7","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3598,"height":3869}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":215},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":430},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":645},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3598,"height":3869},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- the cipher 'M.I.' surmounted by a crown on all the horse brasses\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/old-masters-day-sale-l16037/lot.117.html; accessed 30.03.2020]","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P335","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/old-masters-day-sale-l16037/lot.117.html; accessed 30.03.2020]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder"},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Dieter Koepplin, written communication,14.12.2013]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/old-masters-day-sale-l16037/lot.117.html; accessed 30.03.2020]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 48 x 45.3 cm\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/old-masters-day-sale-l16037/lot.117.html; accessed 30.03.2020]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1515 - 1520","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P335","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P335_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Allegorical Portrait of a Knight, possibly the Emperor Maximilian I as Saint George"},"objectId":974434,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- anonymous noble collection until 1978\n- with Trafalgar Galleries, London\n- sold at Christie's, New York 29.01.2014, sale 2819, lot 161 (online reference no longer available)\n- sold at Sotheby's London, 08.12.2016, lot 117\n[Sotheby's online database: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/old-masters-day-sale-l16037/lot.117.html; accessed 30.03.2020]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30293","title":"Exhib.
