She is wearing a blue cloak, which appears to have a green velvet lining, over a red robe. A green velvet scarf serves as a belt. Her reddish blonde hair is loose and she looks out at the viewer. Christ, who is only concealed by an almost invisible veil, stands on the balustrade together with the infant St John, who is dressed in fur. Both infants are supported by the Virgin.
