He is flanked to the left and right by the two thieves, both have also been crucified on crosses made using crude logs. The assistant figures at the bottom of the cross are divided into two groups, to the left the weeping women and the Virgin with St John, on the far left a peasant figure, to the right a group of three conspicuously dressed men on horseback: one with a moustache wearing a large white turban, and a white undergarment covered by a sleeveless yellow coat with a wide red collar and fastened with laces. The horseman to the right is wearing a cone shaped hat, with a broad rim folded up on one side, a black coat with a fur collar and long, loose-hanging sleeves. The expressive style of the figures equates to the depiction of the landscape with rocky cliffs and tousled and bare trees. \nThe depiction of the Crucifixion differs in format but above all in type from earlier and contemporary late gothic painted versions, as it is not part of a cycle but rather an altarpiece. This raises the question of its original function, possibly as small retable, devotional or private image[1].\nThe painting, formerly in the collection of the Viennese Scottish Foundation, had until 1904 been attributed to Lucas van Leyden, and was identified by Friedrich Dörnhöffer as one of the earliest known works by Lucas Cranach and dated to 1500.[2] It was thus positioned on the pinnacle of Cranach's early work, which since the mid 19th century has gradually been identified as stylistically belonging together and by one artist.[3] It was above all the exhibition in Dresden in 1899, which played a key role in this research.[4]\nAt the same time it was realized that this stylistically coherent body of work - partially panel paintings of on the one hand Christian subject matter on the other hand portraits of Viennese humanists and partially woodcuts which radically differ from the late gothic works by other contemporary artists and indeed his own later works - was produced during Cranach's stay in Vienna.[5]\nFriedländer (1932)[6] was the first to attempt a chronology of the early works created in Vienna. He put the Crucifixion in first position before two woodcuts, which also depict the crucifixion, one of which bears the date 1502. According to Friedländer the drawing in the panel seems more tentative and more undecided than that of the woodcut from 1502 and may be of an earlier date. \nArt historical research has attempted to explain Cranach's artistic origin and the style of his early work. To this purpose reference has been made on the one hand to Albrecht Dürer's woodcut cycles from before 1500, especially the Apokalypse[7] and on the other hand to local artists in Franken, Bavaria and Austria, like the old Bavarian painter Jan Polack[8], whose paintings show similarly distorted and horrible head types and the Bamberg Master of the Hersbruck Panels[9]. Works of art from the artist's immediate vicinity  were also influential like a stone sculpture of St John the Baptist from 1498 by the otherwise unknown Hans Hart(lin) on the fasade of Kronach's town church[10], Pacher's pupil Marx Reichlich and finally the altarpieces by JörgBreu d. Ä, a contemporary painter from Augsburg, working in Austria[11]\nCrucial therefore is, amongst others, the question of where Cranach worked before his stay from 1501/1502 in Vienna. As early as 1899 Flechsig[12] assumed that Cranach must have spent time in Budapest on the grounds of a strangely clothed horseman, which he thought to be Hungarian, in one of the early woodcuts of the crucifixion. The Hungarian looking clothing of the horseman in the Viennese Crucifixion was an additional reason. A document appeared to support this theory. It was assumed that Lucas Cranach may have been related to the Kronacher family who can be traced both in Ofen and Vienna.[13] Johannes Kirchhaimer, 1458 and 61 Dean of the medical faculty at the University of Vienna was with respect to the conflict of 1462/63 between King Friedrich III and his brother the Archduke Albrecht one of Albrecht's leading followers. For this reason he had to leave Viennaduring the reign of Friedrich III and settle in Ofen. There one of his daughters married Albrecht Kronacher, citizen of Ofen, about whom nothing further is known. Albrecht's son, Ulrich Kronacher, returned to Vienna and reclaimed his mother's house; from 1511 he is mentioned as citizen and house owner/landlord in Vienna.\nAnzelewsky questions this line of argumentation.[14] It is impossible to draw conclusions from the mere concurrence of names and the eastern European costume in both the crucifixion woodcuts and the crucifixion panel are polish and not Hungarian. Anzelewsky draws a comparison with the clothes of the soldier in the depiction of the battle of Orsza (Warsaw, NationalMuseum) [15] by an unknown artist (recently attributed to Hans Krell[16]), the minatures in the Behaim-Codex, and similar costumes in the Adoration of the Magi (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie) by Hans Süß von Kulmbach and which was probably painted in Krakau.\nAnzelewsky concludes that before Cranach went to Vienna he must have been in Krakau between 1498 and 1502. Incidentally, similar to Vienna and later Wittenberg, Krakau was a princely residence with a university, which probably offered the artist good prospects. In contrast with the stagnant mannerist style, which had been passed down in the artisan tradition of the late gothic through generations of workshops and their apprentices, the young Cranach's new individual style was suited/appropriate for the quick blossoming Viennese Humanism around 1500.[17] In fact Cranach was in close relations with the main representatives. He made woodcuts for the printer Johannes Winterburger who had been in Vienna since 1493,[18] for Johannes Fuchsmagen he drew monthly depictions after a Filocalus manuscript from late antiquity[19] and he painted a depiction of St Jerome in the desert in 1502[20], which was formerly thought to have been commissioned by Johannes Cuspinian. A drawing of the sculpture 'The Youth of Magdalensberg' which had been discovered in 1502 indicates, just as the copies of manuscripts from late antiquity, the antiquarian interest s of a learned client.[21] Around 1502 he painted portraits of both the humanist Cuspinian and his wife Anna Putsch,[22] in 1503 he painted a further portrait pair of a humanist (in the past wrongly held to be a portrait of the lawyer Stephan Reuss, several times dean of the faculty of law and 1504 rector of the university.) and his wife in a landscape, which equals in appearance and artistic quality the Cuspinian portrait pair.[23] \nIt has been accepted to begin the Danube school with Cranach's early work.  However this term cannot contribute to the explanation of the stylistic phenomenon and its genesis, as has frequently been critically remarked in more recent times.[24] Indisputable is however the fact that the works of art created in Vienna between 1501 and 1503/04 by Cranach are the first manifestation of this new style, which was a few years later embodied in the work of Altdorfer.[Karl Schütz 2005, translated by Smith, cda]\n \n[1]Heiser 2002, 88ff.\n[2] Dörnhöffer 1904, 175\n[3] Bierende 2002, 16 and 21\n[4] Deutsche Kunst-Ausstellung Dresden 1899, Abteilung Cranach-Ausstellung, K.

The join between planks I and II was slightly open in the area of the good thief and there were small losses in the paint layer in this area. In the lower left hand corner there are tiny losses, possibly along a split. It is impossible to tell from this photograph whether or not the reverse of the panel has already been treated. The present cradling dates to 1934 and was carried out in the restoration studio after the painting was purchased. The condition of the painting before this intervention is very scantily documented. Some splits in the panel are mentioned. It is possible that the panel had already been thinned and mounted on an auxiliary support at this stage: an x-radiograph from 1934 shows the painting before it was cradled. However joins are visible along the lower edge, which correspond to the width of the planks of the auxiliary support. Either way, the entry from 1934 in the restoration files only mentions the cradle, but not the auxiliary support . The c. 10 cm long wedge shaped wooden inserts in the upper left and the lower right corners were probably carried out during this campaign. Despite the complicated structure of its support the panel is in a relatively stable condition. A number of small, older hairline cracks are visible along the top and bottom edge of the panel and there is some inactive woodworm present along the top right edge.\n\nPaint Layers:\nThe paint layers are overall in a stable condition, but exhibit tenting in the darker areas of shadow in the red garments. In this area there are numerous tiny, old losses e.g. the garment of the central horse rider with the red cloak or the robes of St John and Mary Magdalene.\nIn the area where fibrous material was applied to the panel the paint layers are abraded and there are tiny losses, particularly in the sky either side of the right hand join. A very defined craquelure can be observed here too.\n \nThere are three larger losses to the right of Christ's cross. In the rest of the painted area there are isolated small, but old losses and some lead white fill used for wormholes. Numerous tiny losses amount to a rather large area of damage in the right foot of the left thief. \nIn addition to the relatively deep abrasion in the sky to the right of Christ there is minimal paint surface abrasion in many areas e.g. the wounds and blood stains of the crucified figures or the tree to the left.\nExamination under the stereomicroscope revealed that many of the glazes have suffered from abrasion e.g. in the faces. On the whole the contours have lost a degree of sharpness due to the abrasion.  \nOld photographs show that there are numerous whitish retouches in the sky (which have been toned in).\n\nVarnish:\nThe natural resin varnish has yellowed and become slightly greyish. Above all in the sky there are disturbing patches. In the coat of the horse rider to the right there is a circular area in which the varnish appears to be less dull/cloudy. There is a glossy drip on the soldier's dark horse. \nExamination under UV light showed that the circular area in the coat of the rider on the right appeared to be darker than the surrounding area. The varnish layer appears to have been thinned here during a cleaning test.\n\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"31.03.2010","endDate":"31.03.2010"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"26.

The unpainted edge (varying in width) of the painting and a barbe created by the ground are visible on all sides with the exception of the right hand side, where they are only partially preserved. The unpainted edges and the barbe do not run parallel to the edge of the panel presumably because the painted area was originally at a slight angle to the panel and the panel was later cropped slightly (probable when it was mounted and cradled). This would have been when the barbe and unpainted edge were partially removed from the upper right hand edge. Along the edges,above all left and right there are remains of an early (original?) black coating (see also IRR image). The edge of the painting was later reworked (retouched). \nVarious areas of the painting present a wide spectrum of different methods of paint application and thickness. In some areas the paint has been applied in a number of layers. Sometimes the final layer is impasto with a localized underpainting as with the trees and drapery, whereas in other areas the paint was applied thinly and distributed with a brush, partially wet-in-wet, as with the landscape in the fore- and background and the clouds. In many areas the slightly toned ground or imprimatura was incorporated into the final image e.g. the part of the tree trunk without bark (central cross).\nIn many areas there is local underpainting, generally brown or grey tones e.g. the Virgin's robe. The blue paint layer (presumably azurite with the addition of lead white to model the folds) is above a brown underlayer, which has been partially left unpainted along the folds. The foreground has an initial warm brown layer, while the trees on the horizon are dark grey and the horses are partially underpainted with light grey.\nA great variety of approaches can be observed in the application of paint in red areas. Cranach employed different paint layer combinations to achieve a variety of hues and shades. In the red garments of the figures around the Virgin the red paint is applied over a lighter layer containing lead white. In other areas the red paint appears to lie directly over the ground, as in the red arm of the Virgin or the garment of the woman behind her. The areas of shadow in the draperies are achieved with a red lake glaze and appear to have an initial black layer and/or to be modulated with black paint in the darkest areas. Other red areas, such as the cover of the brown horse have a continuous black underlayer, followed by a red paint layer with white highlights.\nCranach executed the flesh paint employing an initial localized light paint layer. This layer was frequently applied on a larger area beyond the exact outline of a face, as is clearly visible in the X-radiograph, e.g. in the figure of St. John where the free brushstrokes feather out above his forehead. Heydenreich describes the differentiation between faces -often within one painting- with the aid of varying painting techniques [1].  Variation in the deployment of lead white and brushwork can be observed in the Crucifixion. The highlights in the faces of the women appear to be softer and flatter in their modulation, whereas in the male faces they are more prominent, with visible brushstrokes and appear to have been applied with a pointed brush.\nDepending on the desired shade and hue the flesh paint is modelled with either brown or reddish glazes, that of the women is general kept in a cooler tonality and accordingly contains more lead white. Brown glazes were employed for the male faces apart from the central figurative group. The facial form was achieved with single brushstrokes, not blended, for the highlights. In some of the faces blue pigments were added to the paint to indicate beards.\nThe richness of detail in the figures is remarkable despite their small scale. The women's tears are painted with a very fine paintbrush as a gentle blue stream. The oppressively realistic depiction of the crucified Christ's lips is also in blue paint. The traces of blood on Christ's body were applied to the dry flesh paint whereas the bluish wound is painted wet-in-wet. The blue pigment employed is relatively coarsely ground and irregular in size. Isolated green pigment particles are also present. To depict the metallic shine of the nails highlights in blue paint were employed. Powdered gold was employed for the saints' haloes and the decoration of the robes and tack.\nThe foliage was initially painted with a greenish or brown base tone. A more detailed formation of the leaves and branches followed -partially wet-in-wet - in numerous layers of various green tones and yellowish-green or ochre impasto highlights, which was completed with a now brown glaze [2].  In some areas, like on the right hand side, this lower layer has in its consistency the character of a medium rich glaze and appears to have been spread out with a feathery hairbrush.\n\nThe figures were laid in at an early stage of the painting process. While the figurative groups to the left and right of the central cross are overlapped by the foreground paint (with the exception of e.g. the Virgin's blue robe), some areas of the foreground have also been left uncovered, leaving the brown underpaint visible,   e.g. between the front hooves of the horse on the right. \nThe crucified figures also appear to have been laid in at an early stage, before the sky was painted. Their contours are partially cropped by the sky paint and partially lie side by side without actually bordering on each other. The sky seems to have been painted after the figures. However the crucified figures, the crosses and the large cloud formation were held in reserve, which is clearly visible in the X-radiograph. Here the observation made after infrared examination regarding Christ's loincloth is confirmed. It was not held in reserve as it acquired its shape during the painting process. The crosses were painted during a later stage. \nThe clouds are essentially held in reserve in the blue sky paint with only a very thin light and dark scumble employed over the light ground, partially blended wet-in-wet, to modulate their structure. Only a few wisps of cloud are applied without reserve directly over the painted sky. Only the sides of the panel with the inscription INRI were indicated. The letters were applied directly on top of the clouds.\nPainted areas are juxtaposed in such a way that frequently tiny gaps occur between them where the only slightly covered ground or imprimatura has remained visible. This can be seen with the naked eye but is more clearly evident in the X-radiograph. There are however tiny overlapping painted areas where the artist painted beyond an area which had been held in reserve or where a detail was added later. \nMost of the pentimenti occur where the painted version deviates from the underdrawing, as was already described in the evaluation of the infrared reflectogram. The perspective was altered to the left of the cross and numerous alterations were made to the horses' legs. Corrections within the painting process are hardly present. One exception is where the shaft of the good thief's cross was widened. The process is interesting here: Cranach applied a dark stroke beneath the light paint employed to correct the width. This appears unusual in such a light relatively transparent area and was possible carried out to cover the impasto paint application of the foliage (see infrared reflectograph and X-radiograph).  \n[1] 'Cranach differentiated faces within a painting by different pigment combinations, varying layer sequences and changing brushwork'.

This has led to localised unevenness in the paint layer, which has resulted in increased abrasion of the raised areas [1] - in the X-radiograph this is particularly evident in the area to the right of Christ's cross. Wedge shaped wooden inserts are visible in the upper left and lower right hand corners. They probably date to the restoration carried out in 1934 and have a ground or fill containing lead white.\nStreaky brushstrokes can be observed in some areas, which probably result from the lead white content of an imprimatura e.g. in the foreground or in the torso of the thief on the right hand side. \nVertical, dark bands are visible in the right hand plank that may be plane marks. \nThe use of reserves (for the two crosses on the left and the clouds)  and the slight gaps between adjoining areas of paint are clearly visible in the sky and along the contours of Christ and the thief to the left.The contours of the lance to the left of Christ were incised into the sky paint.\nProminent brushstrokes in the areas where an initial light paint layer for flesh paint or other light colour was applied indicate that the artist only conformed vaguely to the intended forms. Like in the underpainting of the faces, described above, this is also visible in the right hand of the thief on the left as well as in the white horse \nIn addition to the above mentioned abrasion and small losses in the areas where the fibrous material was applied, there are further tiny paint losses in the dark folds of the red robes. The right foot of the thief on the right hand side is rather damaged, exhibiting numerous tiny losses. Three of the largest losses to the right of the Crucified Christ are filled with a material containing lead white. \n \n[1] This fibrous material can become visible on the surface when it is present in areas that have been thinly painted, particularly if the animal skin glue applied as an adhesive has been caused to swell [Most 2009, 89].\n \n[see 31.03.2010 (Monika Strolz) Technical Examination]\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2014]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"},{"filenames":["10_Analysis/AT_KHM_GG6905_FR001_2013_analysis-report-001.pdf"],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Peter Klein","role":"analysed by"}],"overallAnalysis":"","processingDates":{"beginDate":"08.04.2013","endDate":"08.04.2013"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"05.
