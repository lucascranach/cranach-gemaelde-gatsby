The double portrait of Martin Luther and Katharina von Bora, created in the Cranach workshop in 1526 (Private Collection, Hamburg, FR Nos. 189, 190) is similar in this respect. Luther like Johann the Steadfast is shown as a bust portrait in three-quarter profile on the left. His gaze is fixed on a point beyond the picture plane to the right. The depiction of Katharina von Bora exhibits similarities with Johann Friedrich. One theory which would explain this discrepancy within the diptych is that the woman who is by nature smaller and daintier would manifest greater presence if shown as a half-length figure. As the six year old Johann Friedrich is represented in place of a wife and is in reality considerably smaller than his father he is shown frontally as a half-length figure. In contrast Luther’s wife is shown in three-quarter profile, but it is apparent that both face the viewer. Bünsche and Grimm presume that in the case of the double portrait of Luther and his wife the differences are due to the fact that a portrait of the Reformer already existed. According to Dunkerton et al. a frequently used preparatory sketch served as a template for the painting of Johann the Steadfast, whereas Johann Friedrich was portrayed specifically for this painting. Bünsche and Grimm’s theory that the asymmetrical depiction relies solely on the existence of an archetype of Luther seems absurdin the light of the serial production of paintings of both Luther and his wife. Koepplin proposes the theory for the London diptych that the discrepancy may result from different authorship. However after comparison with other diptychs the aforementioned theory that the weaker one of the pair on the right was depicted as a half-length figure also seems plausible.

He wears a black hat decorated with twisted ropes of small gold and seed pearl beads which pass around the brim of the front of his hat, which is also decorated with two small gold tags or aglets, and over the brim, where it appears to be attached with a bow, or where the ends of the ropes protrude. To our left the ear flap is pinned up with a large golden brooch in the form of a cross. It is studded with precious stones, including rubies at either end of the horizontal bars of the cross, and there are pearls in the corners of the arms of the cross. Part of a gold chain is visible to the right of the brooch, and two golden tags or aglets protrude at the left-hand side. A curling black feather with pale yellow circular markings is attached to the top of his cap behind the earflap. His black coat is patterned with dark grey, evidently indicating a damask weave. At the front of his coat are three tiers of slashes fastened by knots fashioned from ropes of gold and seed pearl beads similar to those trimming his hat. The high collar of his white shirt is visible through the coat: it is embroidered with a trellis pattern, in black and gold thread or beads, and trimmed with tiny pearl beads. The collar is fastened with another knot of gold beads. On the thumb of his right hand he wears two rings, one formed from small gold beads and the other a gold ring with a large blue stone. His hair and beard are dark brown and his eyes are also dark brown.\n\nThe two sitters are identified by the coats of arms on the back of the right-hand portrait. They confirm the resemblance of the sitter in the left-hand panel to portraits of Johann the Steadfast (1468-1532) Elector of Saxony, who ruled jointly with his brother Frederick the Wise (1463-1525).\n[Susan Foister, 'Lucas Cranach the Elder, Portrait of Johann the Steadfast and Portrait of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous' published online 2015, from 'The German Paintings before

The varnish underneath was not especially discoloured but it had become sufficiently opaque for there to be a considerable improvement to be saturation of the colours on its removal, above all in the black of the costume where many details of its construction had not previously been apparent. The varnish was readily soluble in IMS (industrial methylated spirits) and is unlikely to be very old. The retouching were also readily soluble although where they were thicker some acetone was used.\nThis panel turned out to be more extensively retouched than had been expected. The cracked area of the cheek previously thought to have been damaged by blister treatment turned out to have been repainted to cover the dark lines or shadows which seem to be part of the final modeling, although slightly rubbed and perhaps darkened in some way. The cracks were in the repaint which was soluble in the same solvents as the other retouching. In the photographs taken during cleaning it can be seen how the much the repaint flattened the structure  and volume of the face. Other retouching on the head were in the hair and beard, especially well-preserved. The hands are more thinly and less vigorously painted and some fading of the colour may have occurred: a band of pinker-coloured paint can be seen along the lower edge where it was once protected by the frame (the planks of the panel have shrunk slightly across the grain so that edges which were once covered are now exposed). The hands have the slightly grey colour characteristic of faded pinks but there may also be a thin film of old surface dirt. No attempt was made to remove this for fear of accentuating the difference between the pale hands and ruddier and more densely painted face.\nThe green background had been extensively stippled with retouching to reduce the uneven application of the transparent green glaze. There are only a few small areas of damage and abrasion (notably in the upper corners) and most of the patchy effect is part of the original bold and rapid technique, perhaps now exaggerated to some extend by slight discoloration of the paint. Some of the marks indicate the end of the brushstrokes, others are the results of blotting the glaze with a rag. In several areas the grids of minute spots of glaze which result from the blotting can be seen. Their survival is a good indication of the excellent state of preservation of the glaze.\nA small area of blistering paint in the background to the right of the head was treated with sturgeon glue and an electrically-heated spatula.\nDuring the cleaning of this panel and NG 6539 evidence was discovered which confirmes that the frames are original. It seems that the panels were not framed when the painting began but that by the later stages of painting, including the application of the glazes, the frames had been fitted. Often the green glazes do not reach the edges and corners, specks of paint from the paintings appear on the edges of the frame rebates (confirmed by sampling as the same paint) and in the case of this panel a smear of the yellow brown mordant used in the gliding of the frame can be seen on the green background along the right edge.\nThe outer edges and the sharpest profiles of the mouldings of the frames are particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the collapse of woodworm tunnels running just below the surface. These areas were injected with Paraloid B-67 in white spirit to consolidate the wood and a few splintered and collapsed areas were shored up with a filler consisting of woodflour and B-67. Retouching of the frames (carried out during the restoration of the panels with pigments in Paraloid B-72) has been kept to a minimum, just reducing some of the lightest and more recent-looking areas of damage. The frames were masked during the final varnishing of the painted surfaces.\nSome of the fillings were replaced or adjusted with a filler consisting of chalk in a polyvinyl alcohol/polyvinyl acetate emulsion filler. To obtain optimum reflectance for the brilliant greens the base colour was painted in watercolours before the application of the first varnish, Ketone-N in white spirit with a few drops of benzyl alcohol to ensure wetting and saturation of the black paint. The rest of the retouching was carried out with pigments in Paraloid B-72 and the final sprayed varnish was Ketone-N in white spirit. In the green areas care was taken to retouch only where damage could be seen to habe occurred ¿ the brushmarking and blotting have been left clearly visible.","signature":{"date":"16.

However, painting of the portraits and decoration of the frames were probably carried out concurrently, since there are also traces of gold from the frame on top of the black background of NG6539 at the left edge The frames are joined with iron hinges and handmade iron nails; this was done after gilding as the tips of the nails are visible in the mouldings.[4]\n[1] [Koepplin 1974]; [Heydenreich 2007 A, 76–9]\n[2] [Heydenreich 2007 A, 76]\n[3] FTIR analysis suggested that the binding medium of the mordant is oil.\n[4] Ibid., p. 78; fig. 60, p. 80, shows the hinge.\n[Susan Foister, ‘Lucas Cranach the Elder, Portrait of Johann the Steadfast and Portrait of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous’ published online 2015, from 'The German Paintings before 1800', London: forthcoming.\nwww.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/lucas-cranach-the-elder-portraits-of-johann-the-steadfast-and-johann-friedrich-the-magnanimous]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[{"inventoryNumber":"UK_NGL_6539","remark":"","text":"Teil eines Werkes"}],"signature":"None","sortingNumber":"1509-001","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"41.30","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of Johann the Steadfast from Diptych: Two Electors of Saxony","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":128},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6538_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6538_FR019_Overall-002-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":255},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6538_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6538_FR019_Overall-002-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":383},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6538_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6538_FR019_Overall-002-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4253,"height":2714},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6538_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6538_FR019_Overall-002-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6538_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6538_FR019_Overall-002.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
