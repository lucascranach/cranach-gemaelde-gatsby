The upper field depicts St Leonhard wearing a black monk's habit and with a tonsur and below is St Nicolaus wearing bishop's vestments. While Leohard is shown reading a book that he holds in his hands and with the broken chains lying before him, St Nicolaus is represented holding a precious vessel in addition to the bishop's crozier. Both saints face to the left and stand on a grey ground against the backdrop of a dark red velvet curtain, which reveals a blue sky at the left edge. \n\nVerso:\nIn the same arrangement Sts Andrew (above) and Gregory (below) are shown on the reverse. The only difference in the basic composition is that the landscape at the right edge of the depiction of St Andrew is richer. Andrew leans on the X-shaped cross while reading a book and pope Gregory caries out a blessing while the Holy Ghost hovers above him in the guise of a dove.  \n\n[GÃ¶rres, cda 2013]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 119.7 x 31 cm [Exhib.
