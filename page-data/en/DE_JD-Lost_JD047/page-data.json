[…] Cranach the Younger borrowed from his father’s woodcut cycle ‘The Martyrdom of the Apostles’ for his own depictions. […] He used compositions from Albrecht Dürer’s painted series of ‘The Seven Sorrows and Seven Joys of the Virgin’ for the representations of ‘The Circumcision’, ‘The Nativity’ and ‘The Nailing to the Cross’. […] Copies of these paintings by a member of the Cranach workshop are preserved in the Erlangen’s university library. […] Furthermore Cranach the Younger drew on drawings from an earlier large workshop commission [the Saints and Passion Cycle for the collegiate Church in Halle] for the ‘Scenes of the Passion’. These drawings are also preserved in Erlangen.","year":1994}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1548,"dated":"about 1553","end":1558,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":""},"description":"53 paintings for the balustrade gallery of the former Marienkirche in Dessau illustrating subjects from the old and new testaments commissioned in 1553 by Duke Georg III of Anhalt. Cranach the Younger's signature 'LVCAS CRANACH DER MITLER MAL.[ER]' and the family coat of arms, the winged serpent, are on 'The Last Judgment', which was the last picture in the series. Sadly the entire series was destroyed together with the church during World War Two. \nVarious donors provided funding for the 53 works and some were represented in the paintings with their portraits. The donors' coats of arms and a short text with their name and title were added to the bottom of each image.  Georg III of Anhalt, his brothers and other family members are represented most frequently. However the nobility of Anhalt and the courtiers of Dessau were also involved. The inscriptions and coats of arms were painted on paper and stuck onto the bottom of the painting after completion. \nThe donors not only paid for their assigned paintings, but also provided financial support for the whole building. \n[Tacke 1994, 84-86]\n\nThe cycle began with the most easterly image on the South side and continued over the west gallery to the North side:\nThis painting depicts: Martyrdom of St James the Less; simplified composition after the woodcut Hollstein 61 \nInscription: 'CHRISTOFF KNOCHE:/'; on the wooden frame: 'S:/ SIMON'\nCoat of arms: silver star on a blue ground; mantling blue and silver; crest: 3 ostrich feathers \nThe donor was captain in Wörlitz \n[Harksen 1937, 25]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: c. 76.5-78 x 65 cm \n[Harksen 1937, 21]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1000,"height":765}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":238},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":475},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":713},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":228,"height":271},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":153},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":306},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":459},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1000,"height":765},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- at the bottom, on paper: \nInscription: 'CHRISTOFF KNOCHE:/'; on the wooden frame: 'S:/ SIMON'\nCoat of arms: silver star on a blue ground; mantling blue and silver; crest: 3 ostrich feathers \nThe donor was captain in Wörlitz \n[Harksen 1937, 25]","inventoryNumber":"DE_JD-Lost_JD047","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113291","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on canvas\n[Harksen 1937, 22]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: c. 76.5-78 x 65 cm \n[Harksen 1937, 21]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1553","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"DE_JD-Lost_JD047","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_JD-Lost_JD047_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Martyrdom of St Simon from a Cycle of 53 works for the balustrade gallery in the former Marienkirche, Dessau"},"objectId":937952,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Ev.
