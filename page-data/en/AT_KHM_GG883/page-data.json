In 1515 together with his brother Georg the Pious (1484 – 1543) he assumed the reins of government over the Dukedom of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Kulmbach from his father Friedrich the Elder (1460 – 1536). Hans Süss von Kulmbach painted a very striking and colourful portrait of the young Casimir (Munich, Alte Pinakothek). \nGG-883 has been recorded in the imperial collection since 1659, but the name of the sitter had already been forgotten. However Lucas Cranach was known as the author. (Leopold Wilhelm Inventory 1659, see provenance)\nChristian von Mechel identified the sitter as Friedrich the Wise [Mechel 1783, 250, No. 56] [probably due to the similarities in fashion with some of the depictions of the elector wearing a wire bonnet (compare engravings showing portraits of the elector after 1509)].\nChristian von Schuchardt did not agree with this designation and therefore Ludwig Scheibler doubted the identification of the sitter as the elector. [Schuchardt 1851, Bd. 2, 139, No. 433], [Scheibler 1887, 279]. The KHM catalogue accepted his view between 1896 and 1928 (see: other titles) \nTheodor von Frimmel was the only one to consider reattribution to an artist from the circle of Bernhard Strigel. [Frimmel 1891, 81-82]\nIn 1928 Benesch reported that a signature and the date ‚1512’ was revealed on the ‚Portrait of a Man’ by Cranach.  [Benesch 1928, in: Collected Writings 1972, Bd. 2, 377].\n In 1932 Friedländer and Rosenberg recognized the Margrave Casimir von Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1481 – 1527) as the sitter after comparison with an inscribed portrait (Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum) [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, No. 152]. They assumed the sitter, who would only have been 31 in 1512, was older (compare with ‚Portrait of Casimir von Brandenburg-Kulmbach, 1511, Hans Süß von Kulmbach, Munich, Alte Pinakothek),  and on the basis of an x-radiograph they doubted the authenticity of the number ‚1’. Since then 1522 has been accepted as being the correct date. [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, 54-55, No. 129]\nKurt Löcher agreed with the opinion of FR, that the Viennese version is the original. He attributed the portrait in Nuremberg to an accomplished workshop member and dated it after GG-883 [Löcher, Cat. Nuremberg 1992, 133]\nAndrew John Martin considers the portrait to be the original version as there are replicas in both Nuremberg and Burghausen.  He views the date of 1522 within the historic context of the year, in which Kasimir settled disputes with his brothers.  [A. J. Martin 2010 in: Exhib. Cat.

Thus this portrait cannot have been painted before 1524. The date may refer to a prototype /template for the portrait. A similar ‘earlier dating’ was established for a portrait of Luther (see Rebel 1994, 137). If the date actually documents the point of completion of the painting 1532 would be the earliest date possible: as the margrave was already dead at this time reference to an earlier portrait would have been necessary. The underdrawing made visible with the assistance of infrared reflectography supports the theory that there was a pre-existing design or prototype, which was transferred to the primed panel: fine lines describe the essential contours of the face, that is the bridge of the nose, the shape of the lips, the eyes and the bags under the eyes and the outline of the beard.’ \n(translated by Smith, cda)","year":2011}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1524,"dated":"after 1524","end":1534,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1522","end":"1522","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"1927 the date \"1512\" was uncovered [Benesch, Pantheon 1928, in: Benesch 1972, Bd. 3, 377-378]                                                                                                       Based on the interpretation of the x-radiograph Friedländer and Rosenberg doubt the authenticity of the '1'.

The additions on the sides are now covered by the frame. \n\nPaint Layers:\nThe paint layers are in a stable condition. In the area of the fur some isolated very fine flaking can be observed as well as a very fine net of craquelure (drying cracks). There is a somewhat larger damage visible on the left side of the fur (loss, abrasion, see infrared reflectograph) as well as isolated small losses and retouches. There are more losses along the left edge of the painting and in the background on the top left. Retouching is located mainly along the side edges and in the background on the left. \n\nAn old black and white photograph shows the painting with a completely overpainted background, the additions on the sides were integrated into the image at that stage. This overpaint was removed during the restoration campaign in 1927, and only remnants are still visible on the additions. \nAt this stage Cranach's signature was revealed in the background on the left. However the number indicating the decade is missing in the date - possibly due to numerous attempts to uncover it, as the dating of the painting to 1512 or 1522 has been disputed [see: Alice Hoppe-Harnoncourt, Exhib. Cat. Vienna 2011, No. 186].\n\nVarnish:\nThe varnish has yellowed and is relatively degraded, which is particularly disturbing in the dark areas of the painting like the fur and the robe. \n\n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"07. 2011","endDate":"07. 2011"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"24.

In raking light the difference is visible between the background, which is thicker due to the underlayers, and the thin application of paint in the figure. A slight ridge can be observed along the contours.  In the x-radiograph the background, which contains lead white in the grey paint, is very prominent. \n\nThe flesh paint was applied first, followed by the clothes and fur, and finally the background, which also defined the contours of the figure. \nThe paint application for the face and dress is very thin. The fur was undermodelled employing an initial transparent layer in a mid-brown tone, which blocked in the basic shape and exhibits obvious brushwork. Light and dark zones in the fur were achieved by varying the thickness of the layers rather than by admixtures. Select areas were emphasized and structured by painting very fine, dark hairs possibly employing a brush with a number of tips. The shape and texture of the beard was achieved with single light and dark hairs painted on a thinly applied monochrome brown base tone. What we often observe in Cranach’s paintings is that single hairs (or other fine details) are executed during a late stage of the painting process, like here along the contours of the left shoulder or along the right contours of the face. The paint employed for these final details often shows a tendency to bead off, a phenomenon which may be due to the binding medium.  \n\nThe painting process described here is clearly visible in the infrared reflectograph. The brushwork of the underlying layers in the background is obvious as is the fact that the contours of the figure were redefined when the background was painted. Elsewhere areas of paint were applied next to each other without overlapping, like between the background and the fur on the left, or between the fur and the face and blouse (also on the left) – here a thin strip of ground was left barely covered. Several finger prints are visible at the top edge of the painting in the centre, which are probably in the underlying paint layers of the background as they are not visible on the paint surface. \n[Translation, Smith, cda 2013]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[{"inventoryNumber":"DE_KSVC_M021","remark":"","text":"gehört zu"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_BStGS_WAF167","remark":"","text":"gehört zu"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_KSVC_M416","remark":"","text":"gehört zu"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_LmKKO_15-572","remark":"","text":"gehört zu"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SWK_6545","remark":"Bildträger aus dem selben Baum gefertigt #Wood for support from the same tree","text":"gehört zu"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_HLMD_GK73a","remark":"","text":"gehört zu"},{"inventoryNumber":"US_artic_1938-310","remark":"","text":"gehört zu"}],"signature":"Artist's insignia left above the shoulder: winged serpent with elevated wings and dated '15[...]2'; in yellow paint with a fine brush\n[Kunsthistorisches Museum, revised 2011]","sortingNumber":"1524-003","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"37.30","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Margrave Casimir of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1481-1527)","type":"Titel"},{"remarks":"","title":"Anonymous Male Portrait","type":"Titel"},{"remarks":"","title":"Friedrich der Weise von Sachsen (1463-1525)","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":266},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152_Image-date-unknown_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":531},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152_Image-date-unknown_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":797},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152_Image-date-unknown_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3000,"height":3985},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152_Image-date-unknown_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152/01_Overall/AT_KHM_GG883_FR152_Image-date-unknown_Overall-001.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
