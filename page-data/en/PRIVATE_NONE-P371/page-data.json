The couple is shown standing in front of a curtain, drawn partially to reveal a distant landscape. A moment of intimacy is caught as the bride lowers her right hand to touch her husband’s, bringing attention to their wedding rings and their unity in marriage. Such informal betrothal or marriage portraits of Saxon nobility would have been extremely rare during this period. Inspiration for this image may have been taken from the popular series of genre prints entitled Small Wedding Dancers by the German engraver Heinrich Aldegrever.\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/the-monogrammist-iw-portrait-of-a-bride-6217407-details.aspx?; accessed 28.05.2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 62.6 x 44.5 cm\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/the-monogrammist-iw-portrait-of-a-bride-6217407-details.aspx?; accessed 28.05.2020]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2737,"height":4000}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":292},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":585},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":877},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2737,"height":4000},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P371","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Master I W","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/the-monogrammist-iw-portrait-of-a-bride-6217407-details.aspx?; accessed 28.05.2020]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"202749","details":[{"name":"Master I W","nameType":"Alternativer Name"},{"name":"Meister I W","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/the-monogrammist-iw-portrait-of-a-bride-6217407-details.aspx?; accessed 28.05.2020]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 62.6 x 44.5 cm\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/the-monogrammist-iw-portrait-of-a-bride-6217407-details.aspx?; accessed 28.05.2020]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1538","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P371","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Portrait of a Bride and Groom Dancing"},"objectId":978731,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- (probably) Lucien Félix Claude-Lafontaine (1840-1909), Paris, and by inheritance until 1962\n- anonymous sale; Musée Galliera, Paris, 10 April 1962, lot 4, illustrated\n- the collection of Drue Heinz \n- sold at Christie's, London, 04.07.2019, lot 18\n[Christie's online database: https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/the-monogrammist-iw-portrait-of-a-bride-6217407-details.aspx?; accessed 28.05.2020]","publications":[],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Private Collection","restorationSurveys":[],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"none","sortingNumber":"1536-012-03","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"62.60","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of a Bride and Groom Dancing","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":292},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":585},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":877},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2737,"height":4000},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P371_FR-none_2019_Overall.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
