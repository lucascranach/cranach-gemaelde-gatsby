These panels portray two of the great intellectual figureheads of their day. Melanchthon was Luther's voice of reason in all matters theological and philosophical and defended his views to the end. He was a key figure in the Lutheran revolution and referred to Luther as his spiritual father.\nThe earliest depictions of these sitters by Cranach are dated 1532 and are of even smaller dimensions. Although dated 1543 the present works depict the sitters at a similar age to the earlier pictures. \n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 20.7 x 15.5 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","exhibitionHistory":"London 1872-3, no. 170 (lent by Carl Haag)","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2466,"height":3260}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":264},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none_2007_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":529},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none_2007_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":793},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none_2007_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2466,"height":3260},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none_2007_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none_2007_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P267","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"'assitance by Cranach himself should not be ruled out'\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":"and Workshop"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]},{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 20.7 x 15.5 cm\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1543","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P267","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P267_FR-none_2007_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Portrait of Philip Melanchthon (1497 - 1560)"},"objectId":951868,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- King Ludwig I of Bavaria (1786-1868), Nuremberg\n- by whom sold in 1832 to Albert Reindel (1784-1853), director of the Nuremberg Academy\n- thence by descent to his son, Jacob Reindel, from whom acquired by Carl Haag (1820-1915) in 1858 [1]\n- thence by descent to the former owner\n- 10.07.2008 sold by Sotheby's, London\n[1] According to undated Haag family documents these two portraits formerly formed part of the collection in the castle at Nuremberg, where the town's art school and library were also located. In 1832, King Ludwig I attended the town festival and, in preparing the castle for his residence, the art collection was transferred to the Landower Bruderhouse; this cloister not being large enough to house the entire collection, a large number of works were sold publicly. Albert Reindel, the director of the Nuremberg art school, acquired a large number of these works, including this pair of portraits. They were then sold by Albert's son to Carl Haag, a pupil of Reindel who had always admired them in the latter's house. \n[...] Carl Haag (1820-1915) was a very notable painter of Oriental subject matter.\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-day-sale-l08034/lot.104.html?locale=en; accessed 20-03-2019]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"30198","title":"Exhib.
