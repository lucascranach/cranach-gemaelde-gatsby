To protect his wife and children the father of the family has killed a lion with his club. Bleeding from the mouth and nose the lion dies a miserable death while looking severely at the viewer. Although he still has his mane he is only half the height of his victor, who has settled himself exhausted on a stone block. He supports his club on the block and rests his other hand on his knee. The young lady approaches holding a small boy by the hand and an infant in her arms, who stretches his hand out to his father. The composition is framed by a wall of foliage consisting of shrubs and trees. In the distance a landscape is visible with a river valley and mountains, one of which has a castle on the summit.\n[Löcher, in Cat.
