A third plane of reality with representations of members of the Oertel family was inserted in the foreground. [...] The upper half of the image shows Saul surrounded by men in armour on horseback in a mountainous landscape. Above this scene Christ is visible in the clouds at the centre of a bright light. A flash of light is directed towards the stumbling Saul. Dazzled by the appearance he lets go of the horse's reins, raises his hands and is caught before falling by one of his companions. [...] Below the dazzled figure of Saul can be seen again, being lead away by his companions. His arms are limp, his stance reflective. The Oertel family is represented at the bottom edge of the painting. According to [Mentz 1604] the members are as follows: (seen from the right of Paul) Veit Winsheim (Oertel) the Elder with his sons and grandsons as well as (on the left) the wife of the Elder and both wives of the Younger Oertel. [...] All three women have their mouths covered with mourning bands.\n[Harasimowicz, Seyderhelm  2015, 166-168]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 165.5 x 130 cm (1.2 cm thick plywood board on the
