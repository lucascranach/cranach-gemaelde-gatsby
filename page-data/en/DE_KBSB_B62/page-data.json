Previous restoration treatments consisting of fills and now discoloured retouches and overpaint partially cover the original paint and compromise its quality and effect. For this reason it was decided to remove the old fills and overpaint after completing the necessary conservation treatment. During this process remains of a hand were discovered on Melanchthon's black gown under the black overpaint. [...] Employing measured retouching the loss was reintegrated in its original context and the hand was as far as possible reconstructed.'\n\n[Exhib. Cat.
