These small format portraits depict Friedrich III as a half-length figure, wearing a brown fur cloak and a white shirt with a dark beret on his head. Later this type was used again, frequently as a companion piece to portraits of Elector Johann who by that time had also died.  \n[Lempertz online database: https://www.lempertz.com/de/kataloge/lot/920-1/1025-lucas-cranach-d-ae-werkstatt.html;
