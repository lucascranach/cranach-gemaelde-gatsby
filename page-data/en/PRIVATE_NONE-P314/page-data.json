Sometimes it is a little flickering, and followed by characteristic painted small dots (not relating to pouncing). It also appears under the hat and hair and the man’s fur collar. The peculiarity of the underdrawing, showing some similarities with Cranach’s but also  some differences, can be presumably referred to a specific personality of his workshop"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Paint Layers and Gilding","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"The quality of the painting is very high, accurate but with evident simplifications to obtain decorations in the clothes and in the heads and headgear. The clouds and the red lights (vermillion) of the velvet dress of the woman are obtained working the painting when it was still fresh. Great ability in using wet-­on-­wet technique also for small details, as eyes and jewels. The flat and blur effect of the flesh tones is given  by the use of a swab to match the lights with the main tone of the skin, sometimes employing directly fingers, as raking light details show.  \n\nPigments include azurite for all the blue and grey-­ blue colours (sky, clouds, mountains), a copper-­ based green for the green areas, also mixed with lead-­based yellow (like lead-­tin yellow), as in the trees. A like lead-­tin yellow is used in the date and in the lighter yellow details, a yellow ochre for darker yellow areas. Vermillion, also mixed with black pigment, constitutes red dresses and flesh tones, together with lead white.  \n\nTechnique and pigments are coherent with 16th century.\n\n[unpublished examination report G.
