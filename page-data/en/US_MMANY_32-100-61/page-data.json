Friedländer and Wilhelm Valentiner.[1] In their 1932 catalogue raisonné of Cranach’s paintings, however, Friedländer and Jakob Rosenberg recognized a divergence from the style of Cranach himself and attributed this portrait along with four others to the Master of the Masses of Saint Gregory (Meister der Gregorsmessen), a painter from Cranach’s studio who worked extensively for Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg.[2] The Metropolitan Museum’s internal cataloguing from 1947 onward situated the portrait within the Cranach workshop.[3] Andreas Tacke upheld Friedländer and Rosenberg’s attribution to the Master of the Masses of Saint Gregory, whom Tacke proposed to identify as the painter Simon Franck, who is documented in the service of Albrecht of Brandenburg.[4] Isolde Lübbeke, however, pointed out significant stylistic differences between the name paintings of the Master of the Masses of Saint Gregory and the group of portraits that includes this one. Maintaining rightly that the “exaggerated plasticity” of the Mass of Saint Gregory pictures is inconsistent with the style of the portrait group, she reassigned the latter, to which she added further examples, to an anonymous painter in Cranach’s circle.[5] Technical examination of the present work (see technical notes) shows furthermore that some aspects of the paint layering, for example in the curtain and the finger rings, are uncharacteristic of standard practices of the Cranach workshop.\nThe group of portraits to which the Metropolitan Museum’s panel belongs now consists of at least ten known works spanning the second quarter of the sixteenth century (1525 – 48), which show a remarkable consistency of style and composition.[6] Although the artist was clearly influenced by the style of Cranach, portraits produced by the Cranach workshop exhibit a greater variety of pose, expression, and motifs. As Lübbeke noted, the almost unwavering adherence to a strict formula suggests a painter operating independently of Cranach. Without exception, the sitters in these works strike a rigidly upright pose. Their hands are almost always crossed one over the other, but rarely are they actually folded together. The expressions tend to be wide-eyed and vacuous. In the early portraits, the sitters’ irises are nearly covered by exaggerated windowpane catchlights, but beginning in the 1530s those reflections diminish or no longer appear. Frequently, as in the Museum’s portrait, the garments are fastened at the neck with black bows. In the earliest works, a green curtain covers the whole background; from 1528 onward, the curtain is pulled aside to reveal a landscape. The artist’s treatment of forms initially displayed a certain smoothness and softness, which in the 1530s gave way to a harder, more severely linear style. In the Museum’s portrait, which belongs to the later period, the impression of hardness and flatness is exaggerated by extensive abrasion of the paint layers.\nThe artist responsible for these portraits appears to have remained active within the regional orbit of Cranach, for the one identified sitter in the group is the University of Leipzig professor Heinrich Stromer.[7] The unidentified painter may have had a career comparable to that of Antonius Heusler, who, after presumably training under Cranach, established himself independently in the mining town of Annaberg, in Saxony, in 1525.[8]\n \n[1]New York 1928, p. 18, no. 32; New York 1929, p. 8, no. 23.

His black coat opens at the chest, showing a white, pleated undershirt embroidered with gold at the neck and fastened with two black bows. A gold chain necklace is tucked beneath his black shirt. Several rings adorn his left\nhand, including a signet ring displaying a coat of arms with a sunburst and initials in mirror image that appear to read MLD (fig. 71).[2]\nThe coat-of-arms has not been identified. The black cap with earflaps suggests that he was a scholar; the D in his initials may refer to a doctoral degree.[3] Citrus fruits like the orange in the sitter's hands were luxury items at the time and could convey social distinction in portraits; in the Christian context they bore connotations of purity, fertility, and eternal life meanings that could carry over into secular portraiture.[4] If the present work had a female pendant, which is quite possible, the orange as a symbol of fertility would have been especially appropriate.[5]\n\n[1] The date of 1537 given in Friedländer and J.

For example, the trees are executed in a systematic manner somewhat similar to the workshop’s practice, but the green curtain is not. The rings were not executed using the workshop’s usual techniques.\nExamination of the inscription with the stereomicroscope revealed coarse yellow particles that display a structure characteristic of the pigment orpiment. Similar particles are also present in the chain, orange, rings, and embroidered collar.[1] The presence of orpiment was confirmed with analysis.[2]\n\n[1] Fitz Hugh 1997, p. 56.\n[2] Gunnar Heydenreich’s extensive study of paintings associated with the Cranach workshop mentions only one analyzed painting in which orpiment was detected, Elector Friedrich III, the Wise (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg); Heydenreich 2007b, p. 133. Unusual features of the support of the Nuremberg painting and other factors suggest that it was not produced by the Cranach workshop but is rather a later copy."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"Not original\n \n[Cat.
