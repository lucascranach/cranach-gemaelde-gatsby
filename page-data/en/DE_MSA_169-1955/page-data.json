[...] the St Martin on the Aschaffenburg panel reveals much about Albrecht's self-image and his self-dramatisation. He is depicted as a bishop in extremely pompous pontifical robes - St Martin was initially an officer, but he later became Bishop of Tours. Albrecht was however not satisfied with the bishop's sumptuous ecclesiastical vestments, which were probably fashioned after his own Episcopal insignia in addition a scarlet cap peeps out from beneath his miter and refers to his dignity as a cardinal. He drops a few coins into the bowl of a beggar, who kneels before him.\nThe pearl embroidery on the pontifical shoes peeping out from under his alba can be clearly seen. In addition to the pearl embroidery there are three coats-of-arms, which have been sewn onto the alba, or undergarment of the bishop. They show a wheel, the coat-of-arms of the archdiocese of Mainz, in the centre the coat-of-arms of the archdiocese of Magdeburg and beside it the coat-of-arms of the diocese of Halberstadt - all three of Albrecht's dioceses.'  \n\n\n[Exhib.
