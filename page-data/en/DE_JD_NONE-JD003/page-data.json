In the lower section of the painting Duke Georg III. of Anhalt kneels beneath a rose bush facing left with his hands held in an attitude of prayer. He wears a fur-trimmed cloak.

Furthermore splashes of a watery, white substance are visible, particularly in the centre of the image. \n\nVarnish\nAccording to the UV-light photographs it may be assumed varnish was applied three times. The varnish with its numerous layers is in good condition and has become brown over time.\n\nPaint Layers\nIn addition to the craquelée caused by the ageing of the support and the paint layers cracking caused by an incorrect technique was observed, like drying cracks and the resulting islands of paint and delamination. The phenomenon of delamination is particularly apparent in the red robe of the angel with the chalice, the sleeping apostle at the front and the robes of the kneeling Duke Georg. The white ground is visible after paint loss from the tented blisters. This damage was definately fostered by a further (the last) varnish application during the last intervention.\nThe cause of the islands of paint can be explained through the sequence of paint application. A tension-filled, dry paint layer was applied over an apparently dry underpaint, which when employing a mixed-media technique also happened in the Cranach workshop. \n\nSupport\n- warping, above all the central plank of the wooden support \n- three chamfered moveable members were inserted on the reverse \n- cropped at the bottom\n\n[Mieth 1993, 2, 3, 31, 34]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"1992","endDate":"1992"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"16.
