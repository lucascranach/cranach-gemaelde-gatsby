This overpaint of the background has probably been part of a treatment, to cover up all the cracks and an old damage in the centre of the painting.\nThe paint layers are built up of separate painted areas, but many places the painted areas are not adjacent to each other. The underpaint is in these areas visible.\nAfter the underpaint was painted the incarnation and shadows were painted on top.
