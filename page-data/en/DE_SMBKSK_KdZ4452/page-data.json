The initial design was executed in black chalk on a pale pink sheet of paper with a ground application. Subsequently the flesh paint was carried out with an initial bright pink paint layer applied with increasing transparency in the areas of shadow. A wreath of hair in brown and yellow paint completes the face, whereas the remaining composition was merely indicated with brown brushstrokes. This economic and effective oil sketch is a technique developed by Cranach the Elder. Our sheet also corresponds with what H. Geissler referred to as idealized portraits, which he nevertheless assumes were recorded in front of the model.
