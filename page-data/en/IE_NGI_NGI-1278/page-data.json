The linen is attached to three vertical panels of modern plywood. The slightly uneven balance between the right and left sides of the picture suggests that the right border of the linen may have been trimmed by a few centimetres. \nThe paint surface is in poor condition. There are several vertical cracks in the surface, including two which extend the length of the paintings at 10.7 cms and 24.1 cms from the left border. The paint is particularly thin on the faces of Christ and the Virgin. The Virgin's neck and robe have been considerably retouched and there is extensive craquelure in the black dress and the black hanging. Discolouration of the varnish is also apparent. The painting was restored in 1955.'\n\n[Cat. Dublin 1987, 11, No. 1278]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"1987","endDate":"1987"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"18.
