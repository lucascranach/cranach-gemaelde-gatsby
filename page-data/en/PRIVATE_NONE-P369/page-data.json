However, unlike the painting in Augustusburg castle, where the figure is a representation of Joseph, here he is one of the shepherds, gazing at Christ while holding his hat in both hands.\n[Herrschaft, cda 2020]","year":2020}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1555,"dated":"about 1560 - 1570","end":1575,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1573","end":"1580","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"[cda 2020]","text":"after 1573"}],"remarks":"[Im Kinsky online database: https://imkinsky.com/de/kaufen/ergebnisse/127/5.664//77384-lucas-cranach-ii-werkstatt; accessed 27.05.2020]"},"description":"The Adoration of the Shepherds is shown here set inside a stable with precisely aligned beams and brickwork.
