Alton Abbey, later Alton Towers, by 1835.[1] \n(According to the NG MS catalogue the picture was previously in a Nuremberg collection.[2] The Earl of Shrewsbury probably acquired it from Friedrich Campe of Nuremberg (1777-1846), a bookseller and publisher. Campe, who collected early Northern European paintings (including the portraits by Robert Campin, NG653.1 and 653.2), sold a picture named as a Van Eyck to the earl in 1829 to finance his journey to England, but the Cranach is not recorded in his possession.[3] \n- Earl of Shrewsbury Sale, Alton Towers, 8th July (3rd day) 1857, lot 259, bought for the National Gallery [4]\n\n[1] [Waagen 1838, vol. III, 259-60], recording his visit in 1835: 'A Female portrait, half the size of life; remarkably careful in the execution and in a very warm tone'; [Alton 1850, 21], 'Lucas Cranach - A Female portrait'.\n[2] The NG MS catalogue states that the picture was 'formerly in the possession of a family at Nuremberg from whom it was obtained by the late Earl of Shrewsbury'. As Levey noted (Levey 1959, p. 19), if the the Earl of Shrewsbury's picture came from the Campe collection, it is unlikely to be identical to the picture in the Ottley sale in London on 25 May 1811 (9, Cranach): 'it is probable that this is the Portrait of a Princess of Saxony', a provenance proposed in the 1929 catalogue.\n[3] [Passavant 1836, vol. II, 81] (referring to paintings by Van Eyck and Memling): 'The Earl purchased the two last-mentioned pictures from Mr Campe, of Nurnberg'. The painting named as a Van Eyck was sold to Shrewsbury by Campe in 1829 to finance his journey to England: see [Reynot 1962, 35]. The Cranach might have been sold at this time also, or on the London visit, but there are no records of it being in Campe's collection; it is not included in Umrisse zu Oelgemaelden aus der Dr. Fr. Campe'schen Sammlung ... n.d., which contains 18 line engravings of paintings in Campe's collection, among which are three works by Cranach.\n[4]National Gallery Minutes of Board Meetings in the National Gallery Archive:\n1st June 1857: 'Read a Report from the Director (Charles Eastlake), dated 1st June 1857, recommending that at the sale of the Alton Towers Collection the sum of £150 should be offered for No.269, the Virgin and Child with heads of two angels below; an early work of Raffaellino del Garbo.  And that the sum of £80 should be offered for no.259, a small portrait of a lady, by Lucas Cranach...'\nThese purchases, at the prices named, were approved.\n30th July 1857: 'Referring to the recommendation recorded in the minutes of a former meeting, and since sanctioned by the Treasury, that two pictures should be purchased at the sale of the Alton Towers Collection, at, or within prices named, the Director reported that one of the pictures, no.259, a small portrait of a lady by Lucas Cranach, had been purchased for the sum of £50\"8\".'\nFile - NG5/227/1857: Contains the Director's Report on the Alton Towers Collection.

The original cracking needed to be reduced with the light retouching to regain the continuing form of the lighter features.\nThe picture was restored using Paraloid B72 and varnished with semi-matt MS2A varnish.\n[Report by A.M.

Very small, - flakes of transparent red, black and a very yellow ground. The thin red is a lake on alumina, oil bound but there does appear to be some protein present. The FSD trace (and 2nd derivative) show – amide bands at 1645 (1650; 1659) and 1542 (1559; 1542). Traces of chalk, no wax.\n\nAre the blacks in Cranachs inorganic or organic? There are no phosphate bands, there are weak calcite type chalk bands, and much of the ill-resolved fingerprint region has weak derivatives. There is the possibility of some red lake being included as this is very difficult to see amongst the black. There does appear to be some protein – 3300; overtone at 3058; 1635; 1650; 1557; 1542. Also oil – CH stretches; C=O at 1704-1770. Some yellow/white paint in this sample gives a spectrum of gypsum with protein – is this ground?\n\nNB. DP – 1320 cm-1 suggests presence of oxalate rather than protein [DP; August 2013]\n\nGC-MS: The paint medium was identified as linseed oil [A/P 1.3; P/S 1.4; A/Sub 6.8]\n\nInorg2B: Red lake, possibly madder.
