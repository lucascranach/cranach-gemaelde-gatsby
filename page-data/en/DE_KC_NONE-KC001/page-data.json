Coswig","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Anke Oelerich","role":"examined by"}],"overallAnalysis":"Condition Report \n\nSupport:\nThe original support - an oak panel - is no longer in its original state. Before it was cradled it was thinned to a thickness of 5 mm. The original thickness can be estimated at 1-1.5 cm based on the dimensions of the panel. \nBoth the edges of the panel and occasional exit holes suggest the former existence of woodworm damage, which appears to have compromised the stability of the panel. Judging by the size of the channels and the exit holes it was probably infested with the anobium punctatum beetle.\nThe visible channels and exit holes on the front of the panel were filled during the last treatment. For this purpose a brown woodfill was employed in areas where the wood was exposed and a chalk/glue fill within the painted area. \nDuring treatment a hairy insect larva of c. 2 mm in length exited the support. Examination under the stereomicroscope enabled it to be classified among the dermestid family. These insects do not feed on wood, however they do nest in wooden material. They are c. 6-16 mm in length and they create entry holes of c. 3-6 mm in diameter. \nIt may be assumed that this larva is an isolated example as these insects prefer to be near food. However as numerous insects of c. 7-10 mm were found in the church a reason should be found. \nThe new, auxillary support is 10 mm thick and is made of coniferous wood. A grid cradle was incorporated into this panel to inhibit a potential warping of the panel. The well-known disadvantages of such an intervention - which causes tenting in the paint layers - only occurred to a lesser extent. Therefore at present there is no reason to remove the cradle. However the surface of the painting should be monitored to ensure that large deformations do not develop. \nThe cradle members are 3.5 cm thick and are made of oak wood. The entire thickness of the panel is 5 cm. It weighs numerous kilos. \nThe two joins on the left are slightly open (less than 1 mm) along a length of numerous centimetres. Generally the location of the joins are visible due to the typical cracking pattern and show that the planks were aligned vertically, at a slight angle. The original external dimensions of the panel were cropped by c. 10 mm. An assessment of the edges of the panel showed that along the upper and lower edges the wood was left exposed, whereas along the sides the painted surface extends to the edge of the panel suggesting these were trimmed. \n\nGround:\nThe ground is in realitively good condition. There is no indication that the adhesion of the binding medium has weakened, or evidence of powdering or delamination. Its adhesion to the support is stable. Occasionally there is a small tendency to flaking along the edge, which requires consolidation. \n\nUnderdrawing:\nThere is no damage to the underdrawing \n\nPaint Layers:\nThe paint layers are in good condition. There are no large losses. Losses where the ground is exposed are very limited and almost all located along the edges of the joins and the exit holes. \nSome of the thinner paint layers and glazes were abraded during a previous cleaning campaign. In this case the thin paint layers were slightly overcleaned where the paint surface stands in relief. [...]\nAlso resulting from the last conservation treatment are brown, patchy remnants of a gluten glue. These are essentially located at the edge of the painting, but occasionally on the picture plane. They are beneath the varnish layer and are probably remnants of the glue used to consolidate the paint layers and attach the auxillary support.  \nNumerous small losses have been filled and retouched. The manner and subtlety of this old restoration suggests a high standard of professionalism. It may have been carried out by a local conservator. The retouches have discoloured in some places. \nAs [in the above section] already implied the cradle caused isolated tenting. This is evident as a rough split within the otherwise homogenous network of aging cracks. To date no flaking has occurred. \nIn the darker sections of the sky isolated blooming of the medium has occurred. This is the result of microbial exposure or the high relative humidity in the church. However the local light patches are not of such magnitude to warrant regeneration or retouching. \nIn the cracquelée of some green glazes dark discoloured areas or crusts have developed. This could be a degradation product, like that on the varnish surface. (The saponification of lead white admixtures has caused an increase in the refractive index). The increased transparency of the paint surfaces has made the underdrawing beneath visible to the naked eye as well as various pentimenti. However this is the result of a natural ageing process. \nThere is a date at the lower third of the shaft of Christ's cross. This is the year in which the panel was created, 1556. An artist's insignia has not been found. \n\nSurface coatings:\nThe natural resin varnish applied during the last conservation treatment (probably about 1929) among others to protect the paint layers has altered. Significant microbial contamination on the surface (examination under the stereomicroscope showed clear evidence in the cracks) has caused degradation and the formation of dark degradation products along the edges of the cracks, which has left the layer in a fragmentary state. Here it no longer functions as a protective coating. \nIn addition, but less of a conservation concern, these damaged areas considerably compromise the optical appearance of the image. The varnish layer also exhibits differing degrees of blooming, yellowing (due to an uneven application) and an irregular surface gloss. \nThe present varnish layers therefore satisfy neither preservation nor aesthetic functions required to justify that they remain. Considering that the relative humidity values where the painting is hanging are high, frequently over 70%, and given the potential for further damage it would seem unprudent to retain them. \n\nPatina:\nThe dark appearance of the painted surface is caused by a patina consisting of various components, essentially soot, dust and insect dirt. The patches and dark discolourations within the network of cracks are mostly due to the damaged varnish. The layer reacted positively to cleaning tests employing enzymes. \n\nFrame:\nThe basic structure of the frame is intact. The front and reverse exhibit evidence of woodworm damage ( Anobium punctatum).\nThe profile members are in part loose and require regluing. The ground and gilding is due to wood shrinkage loose in many places. Here in addition to new losses, old fills and retouchings are visible. The gilding is abraded along the edges of the profile, exposing the red bole. \n\n[Conservation report,  Anke Oelerich 2009]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"03. 2009","endDate":"03. 2009"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"22.

It appears that the openings are not static but rather that the panel reacts to the climatic fluctuation (despite the cradle). \nIf the join were reglued this would inhibit the movement of the panel, which could result in paint flaking and tenting. \nThe paint layers - where necessary - should be consolidated along the edge of the joins and the painted edge where disrupted reintegrated. \n\nTreatment: \n\nPainting:\n- examination of the painting under the stereomicroscope and in UV light to establish the condition \n- cleaning tests with enzymes to establish the solubility of the patina \n- cleaning tests with solvents to establish the solubility of the varnish \n- photographic and written documentation of condition \n- consolidation of loss paint with animal skin glue \n- surface cleaning with enzymes (spit-cleaning) and then distilled water \n- the cradle on the reverse was cleaned with a small bristle brush and a hoover \n- varnish removal employing Isopropanol in Isooctan 1:1, swab, rolled \n- removal of the brown remnants of glue with a swab, spit and the applicationof heat \n- smaller losses and exit holes were in part filled with a chalk/glue fill material (Helix EE gluten glue in fine chalk) \n- the fills were smoothed and textured with a dental probe, a scalpel and damp swabs \n- an isolating layer of shellac in ethanol was applied to the fill \n- a new thin layer of varnish (dammar resin) was applied \n- the new varnish was brushed with a dry brush to make it matt \n- the losses were retouched with gouache and mastix-resin paint (\"Maimeri Restauro\")\n- the discoloured retouches were reworked with mastix-resin glazes \n- the discolouration was retouched with mastix-resin glazes \n\nFrame: \n- the profile battens were reglued with gluten glue ('Helix EE', Hecker)\n- consolidation of loose gold particles with animal-skin glue \n- dry surface cleaning \n- the losses in the gilded profile batten were filled with a chalk/glue fill material ('Helix EE'- gluten glue in fine chalk)\n- the fills were smoothed with sandpaper and a damp swab \n- an isolating layer of shellac in ethanol was applied to the fills \n- the gilding was retouched employing water clours and 'Kolibri-Perlelanz' pigments (Kremer) in Gummi Arabicum\n- strips of wool felt were attached to the rebate with a gluten glue ('Helix EE'); before this paper strips were attached to the wooden surface \n\nRecommendations:\nThe following standard values should be maintained to ensure the preservation of the painting: temperature 18-20°C at a relative humidity of 55-60% (see.: G. Thomson, The Museum Environment, Second Edition, London 1986, p. 88). Frequent, severe climatic fluctuations and direct sunlight should be avoided. \nSurface cleaning when necessary should only be carried out with a soft dry animal-hair brush. \nThe painting is of particularly high quality and would benefit from a technical and an art historical examination. \n\n[Conservation report,  Anke Oelerich 2009]","signature":{"date":"22.
