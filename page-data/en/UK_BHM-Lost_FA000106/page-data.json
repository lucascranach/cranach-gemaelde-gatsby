Below a poem has been pasted onto the panel. This portrait was produced along with that of Frederick III after the latter's death. The portraits were produced as part of the order placed with Cranach's workshop in 1532 for sixty portraits of the two late Electors of Saxony. The composition, with John I facing to the left while Frederick III faces to the right in the companion work, suggests that they were originally part of a triptych with a portrait of the incumbent Elector of Saxony, John Frederick the Magnanimous, being placed in the centre.\n[Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, revised 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 20.7 x 14.1 cm\nDimensions including frame: 29 x 23 x 3.7 cm\n[Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, revised 2016]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":524,"height":771}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":294},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":589},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":883},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":524,"height":771},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"Verse in the text block beneath the image \n[Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, revised 2016]","inventoryNumber":"UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2016]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, revised 2016]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 20.7 x 14.1 cm\nDimensions including frame: 29 x 23 x 3.7 cm\n[Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, revised 2016]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1532","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BHM-Lost_FA000106_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"John I 'The Constant', Elector of Saxony"},"objectId":835745,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Brighton Museum & Art Gallery","provenance":"- Henry Willet by 1874\n- given to Mrs Reid before 1918\n- donated to Brighton Museum & Art Gallery by Mrs Russell Reid in 1918\n- stolen\n[Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, revised 2016]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"20 - 21","referenceId":"29477","title":"Cat.
