The joint was probably open at some stage. The planks subsequently warped differently in the horizontal direction, at some stage the reverse was reinforced with wooden blocks. Splits were reinforced with tow. The area around the joints exhibits recent plane marks and open woodworm channels, marks from a block plane run across the grain. The reverse has a dark brown coating. \nPaint layers:\n- there are fills and retouches along the joint between the 2nd and 3rd planks \nVarnish:\n- the painting has a glossy resin varnish, which was probably applied repeatedly with a brush. The strong fluorescence of this layer restricts the identification of retouches under UV light to a few relatively new ones. \n[Cat.
