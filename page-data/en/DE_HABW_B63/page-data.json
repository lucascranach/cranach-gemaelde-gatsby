As far as we know these portraits are the earliest and for some decades the only representations of this subject in Germany to have survived. Although they were published in 1904 in ‘Bau- und Kunstdenkmälern der Stadt Wolfenbüttel’ the paintings from Wolfenbüttel are not mentioned in any other previous scholarly literature. \n[Cat.
