His outfit is particularly ornate: a white garment with a richly decorated collar under a robe of sumptuous cloth is complemented by his  fur-trimmed cloak. His hands are folded and he wears a ring on the index finger of his left hand. The background directly behind him is dark, but a window on the the right hand side of the image reveals an expansive landscape.    \n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 56.5 x 36.8 cm \n[Weltkunst XLIV 1974, 1992]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3652,"height":5628}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":308},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":616},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":925},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3652,"height":5628},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1920,"height":2894}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":302},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001r-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":603},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001r-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":905},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001r-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3839,"height":5788},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001r-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001r.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":301},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001v-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":603},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001v-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":904},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001v-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1920,"height":2894},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001v-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_KOE_Overall-001v.dzi"}}]},"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P342","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2020]","role":"Artist","suffix":"and workshop"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Weltkunst XLIV 1974, 1992]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 56.5 x 36.8 cm \n[Weltkunst XLIV 1974, 1992]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1526 - 1528","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P342","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P342_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Prince-Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony"},"objectId":976689,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- private collection, Great Britain\n- sold by Sotheby's, London 26.03.1969, lot 95 [1]\n- sold by Christie's, London, 29.11.1974 \n[1] [handwritten annotation on the reverse of a b/w photograph;
