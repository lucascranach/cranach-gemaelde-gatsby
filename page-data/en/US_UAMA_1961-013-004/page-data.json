He related the panel to the Adoration of the Magi at Gotha (Landesmuseum), where the Virgin and Child are somewhat similar in sentiment, and found it contemporary with the large altar in the Johanneskirche (by Neustadt a.d. Orla, 1513).[3] Heyck also commented on the somewhat uncharacteristic qualities of it, finding it 'Cranachish'.[4]\nGlaser discovered that the painting was the central panel of a triptych, whose wings were then in the Liechtenstein Collection. He dated the panel c.1513-14.[5]\nFriedländer and Rosenberg, following Flechsig's views very closely, dated it c. 1513; they pointed out derivation from Dürer's engraving of 1511, the Virgin and Child with a Pear (n.4I), and noted that 1513, the year in which it was probably painted, was the one in which Dürer sent several of his prints to Frederick the Wise.[6] They suggested that the unusually large size and somewhat flat, impersonal execution point to the Madonna and Child as being a workshop product.[7]\n\n[1] Max J.

The bare foreground is covered with pebbles. Christ's left index finger points down. \n\n[1] Christ points down to the pebbly, arid foreground, possibly alluding to the first steps of the Passion. This gesture is unique in Cranach's many depictions of the Child. The foreground may refer to Golgotha, while the wooden frame on which the Virgin and Child are seated suggests the entombment; the tree to the right, the wood of the Cross, and the ruined fortress at the upper left to the Old Dispensation. Christ's nudity may also refer to that of the Lamentation.\n\n[Cat.
