The fourteen Holy Helpers are positioned in an isocephalic arrangement to the left and right behind her. The virgin wears the same robe as on the central panel and the second moveable wing panel on the left. Her halo consists of two circular rings. Each of the saints is depicted with an attribute and wearing a single ringed halo. The fourteen Holy Helpers are from left to right: Cyriacus, Blaise, Hubertus (Eustace), Pantaleon, Catherine, Aegidius, Dorothea, Barbara, Dionysius, Margaret, Acacius, Vitus, Christophor and Erasmus. Only St Catherine engages with the infant Christ and accepts grapes from him. The group is shown against a brown unstructured background.\n[Görres, cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of painted surface: 92.7 x 224.7 x 6 cm\n[Heydenreich, cda 2015]","exhibitionHistory":"-
