(45) And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the midst. (46) and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit, and, having said this, he gave up his spirit.' The Latin equivalent to Christ's last words are written above the cross in the Dublin picture. Christ looks up towards heaven and his mouth is open to speak the final words. That Christ is alive is emphasised by the absence of the wound in His side which was pierced after his death. The billowing loin cloth adds to the portrayal of a particular instant in the Crucifixion narrative and the dramatic effect is enhanced by the way Christ is silhouetted against the dark sky.'\n\n[Cat.
