Venus looks out at the viewer, wearing only a transparent veil, which seems to emphasize her nakedness rather than conceal it. Her weight is supported on her right leg and she has turned slightly towards Cupid. He is holding a honeycomb in his right hand and seeks her assistance by pointing at the bees to explain that he has been stung. She informs him that his arrows of Love are no less painful and appears to point to the Latin inscription in the upper left corner. The motif alerts us to the consequences of abandoned lust.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 51 x 35 cm\n[Page from an auction catalogue, Paris, 23.06.1978, no. 48; Koepplin Archive]","exhibitionHistory":"Paris 1956, no. 29","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1949,"height":2828}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":290},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":580},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":871},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1949,"height":2828},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P447_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- in the upper left corner:\n'DVM PVERALVEOLO FVRATVR MILLA CVPIDO // FVRANTI DIGITVM CVSPITE FIXIT APIS // SIC ETIAM NOBIS BREVIS ET PERITVRA VOLVPTAS // QVAM PETIMVS TRISTI MIXTA DOLORE NOCET.'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P447","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Letter from D.
