The infant lies in a crib surrounded by golden rays and angels. The Virgin kneels before her child with her arms crossed. Her distant gaze represents the 'inner vision' of events from the history of salvation. In the background a landscape with the annunciation of the shepherds is visible through the partly collapsed back wall of the stable. Separated from the biblical illustration by a wall the donor family kneels in the foreground. Benedikt Krull is larger and he has more individual features than the rest of the family. The blessing comes directly out of his mouth, and the dating corresponds with the year of his death. \n[Maria Dieters, Exhib. Cat.
