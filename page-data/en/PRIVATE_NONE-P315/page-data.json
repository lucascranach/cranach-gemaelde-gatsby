Both the x-radiograph and the infrared reflectogram show that the background was scraped off and repainted. Examination under the stereomicroscope revealed small islands of blue paint in the background, suggesting that it was originally blue. There are also traces of black paint in the background at the top left. These may be remnants of an inscription or coat of arms. The face, draperies and hands are also abraded and exhibit extensive retouching. \n \nThe join at the centre of the panel is slightly open at the top and the bottom. There is some paint loss here. Further loss was observed in the paint layers and the wooden support along the edges of the panel. The varnish is recent. \n[unpublished examination report, G.
