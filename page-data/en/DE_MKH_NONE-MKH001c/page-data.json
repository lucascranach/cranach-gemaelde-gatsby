He is a follower of St Maurice from the Thebian Legion. An overthrown leader lying at his feet represents his victory over paganism. The saint is turned to the central panel and holds a banner with a red cross on a white background in his hand. His left hand rests on the hilt of his sword. \n\nVerso: The saint is shown as a full-length figure positioned under an arch with renaissance ornamentation. This architectural element is repeated on all the panels open at this stage. St Augustine is wearing splendid bishop's vestments and in his hands he holds a crozier and a book with a pierced heart resting on it. This attribute refers to a passage in the 'Confessions' of Augustine where it is reported  that his heart was pierced by love. His head is framed by a circular, transparent halo. \n\n[Görres, cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of painted surface: 264 (approx.) x 100.8 cm\nDimensions including frame: 285 x 114
