Her face is inclined to the right with an expression of suffering and she stares into the far distance. In her right hand she holds a long dagger pointed against her breast. In her left hand she holds a transparent veil in front of her body, which is wrapped around both arms. In addition she wears an overcoat around her waist, which hides her vulva. She also wears a neckband and a delicate chain, which hang over her right breast. Her hairstyle indicates that she had a bonnet. The background is dark. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King' son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour  enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50.5 x 36.2 cm\n[Written correspondence from the former owner with D.

Cat. Basel 1974, 666, No. 583]\n\n- The painting has been owned for generations by the Marquis of Rafal family and probably came to Spain from Vienna when by the peace of Vienna the marquis, partidary of the Archduke of Austria in the Spanish War of Succession in the 18th century, was amnestied and could return from the exile in Vienna to Spain.\nThe countess of Via-Manuel (1850 - 1929), she was also Marquise of Rafal, sent the painting from her palace in Orihuela to her house in Madrid.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 39) the picture was kept by the republicain 'Junta de Recuperación del Tesoro Artistico' and was sent to the Prado Museum. This painting was included in the expeditions organised by the Prado Museum durch the Civil War to send the paintings out of Madrid that ended near the border with France, first in the Figueras castle and then in the Perelada castle. (Once there was a label on the reverse of the painting giving information about that journey.)\nIt was perhaps at the Prado Museum that Christian Zervos , friend of Picasso - at the time director of the Prado - had the opportunity to see the picture and take a photo later employed in his book. \nAfter the war, the picture went back to the owner, the Count of La Granja. \n[mail correspondence of the former owner with D.
