Eve offers Adam an apple with her right hand, while supporting herself on the tree with her left hand. Adam has raised a hand in a questioning gesture and with the other hand he holds a branch, the leaves of which cover their most private parts. At the right edge a snake coils itself around the tree trunk.","dimensions":"former dimensions of support: 50 x 36 cm \n[Cat.
