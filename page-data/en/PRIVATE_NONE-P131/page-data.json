Her dress is made of red velvet with decorative slits on the sleeves, and exhibits a stiff collar with braid and a floral pattern beneath the neckline. It is complemented by a large linked chain and a neckband set with pearls and precious stones with a pendent worn over a transparent pleated fabric. A broad-rimmed hat with an ostrich feather fitted over a pearl snood makes her appear even more imposing. She holds holds a bunch of grapes and two apples in a white cloth, which covers her hands - for Cranach an unusual variant. The dark background is punctuated at the top right corner by a window that reveals a landscape with a view of a town and a castle.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 81.6 x 55 cm\n[Sotheby's Sold Lot Archive;
