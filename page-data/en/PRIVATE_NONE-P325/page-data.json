He has inclined his head to look up at his mother Venus. In an attempt to ward off the bees swarming around him he has raised his left hand to his forehead. Still holding the honeycomb in his right hand he stands on a narrow strip of ground in front of the tree from which he has taken the honeycomb. Only a small section of the leg of Venus is still visible at the right.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 78 x 34 cm\n[Lost Art Internet Database: http://www.lostart.de/DE/Verlust/584410; accessed
