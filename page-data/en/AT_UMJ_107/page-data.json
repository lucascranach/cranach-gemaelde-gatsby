Hera, Aphrodite and Athena change their positions. The costume-like attire of the protagonists, that quite conforms with the taste of about 1500, can be found in paintings by Cranach of other subject matter. In the painting in Graz the armour worn by Paris conforms with contemporary fashion, whereas the Gods' messenger Hermes wears an imaginary costume. [...]\nA comparision of the painting in Graz with the most well known (Cologne, Berlin, New York) and dated (Copenhagen, 1527; Basel, 1528; Karlsruhe, 1530) versions allows us to assume a dating of about 1515. A more detailed examination of this work reveals some stylistic and iconographical similarities. The version in Cologne, dated to about 1513 marks a terminus ante quem non. The version in Graz - of which there exists an almost identical version in the Uffizi in Florence - differs from the dated paintings in numerous details; for example the pictorial space is more restricted here and the landscape background appears as a mere extract. \n\n[G.
