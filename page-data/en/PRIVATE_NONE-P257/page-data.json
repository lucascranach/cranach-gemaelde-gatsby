Set against a green velvet drape, which sets off her red dress and dainty cap, the sitter appears to be one of Cranach's noble class patrons. However, the panel was originally larger, depicting the subject of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist. In 1915 it was included in the sale of Highly Valuable Paintings by the Great Masters.... from the Blakeslee Collection, described as The Jeweler's Daughter, with the head of John the Baptist painted over and replaced by a box filled with jewellery. Before being sold in the sale at the Anderson Galleries in 1934, the picture was cut down and the composition was adjusted. \n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.3.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 57.2 x 48.2 cm (cropped)\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.3.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","exhibitionHistory":"New York 1943, no. 21","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1947,"height":2305}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":237},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":474},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":710},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1947,"height":2305},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1707,"height":2362}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":277},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_KOE_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":553},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_KOE_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":830},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_KOE_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1707,"height":2362},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_KOE_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/12_KOE/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_KOE_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P257","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.3.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32402","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on canvas, transferred from panel\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.3.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 57.2 x 48.2 cm (cropped)\n[Sotheby's online database; http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/important-old-master-paintings-n08825/lot.3.html?locale=en; accessed 19-03-2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1540 - 1560","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P257","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P257_FR359E_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Judith with the Head of Holofernes"},"objectId":951806,"objectName":"FR359E","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- private collection, Paris, by 1910\n- with Blakeslee Galleries, New York\n- their sale, New York, American Art Association, 21-23 April 1915, lot 66, titled The Jeweler's Daughter\n- with Ehrich Galleries, New York\n- their sale, New York, American Art Associatin/Anderson Galleries, 18-19 April 1934, lot 38 (as Lucas Cranach the Elder)\n- there purchased by A.L.
