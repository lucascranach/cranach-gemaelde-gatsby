The group is moving towards the left, the man at the front has already turned in the opposite direction and possibly announces an imminent change in direction to the rest of the group. A castle on a rocky outcrop is visible further in the background. The branch of an apple tree bearing fruit is visible in the top right corner of the composition. The perspective employed renders it closer to the viewer than the rest of the composition. The panel is more than likely a fragment from an originally larger depiction of Samson and Delila, less likely, but also conceivable, is that it was part of a scene showing the Agony in the Garden. \n[Görres, cda 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 21 x 26.5 cm\n[D.
