She is presented as the epitome of beauty and high fashion, as understood at the courts of the dukes of Saxony during the early sixteenth century. Her hair is bound up. She wears a plumed red beret over a calotte of gold and silver threads decorated with pearls, a style in vogue around 1530. Her dress is red with golden orange brocade and puffed sleeves. Around her neck Judith wears a gold collar and two massive short chains with flattened links, a further two long gold chains are draped over her chest. This combination of collar and chains was particular to the court of the Saxon dukes and continued until the 1540s. The rings on Judith's fingers poke through the slits of her thin silk gloves. \n[cda 2019]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 61 x 40 cm\n[Muzeum Powiatowe w Nysie, revised 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":null,"inscription":"- on the blade of the sword near the hilt:\n'RXC'\n[cda 2019]","inventoryNumber":"PL_MN_MNa-SA101","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Muzeum Powiatowe w Nysie, revised 2019]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"113288","details":[{"name":"Werkstatt Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"Polska > voivodships > Opole > inhabited places > Nysa","term":"Nysa","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"Polska > voivodships > Opole > inhabited places > Nysa","term":"Nysa","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Muzeum Powiatowe w Nysie, revised 2019]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 61 x 40 cm\n[Muzeum Powiatowe w Nysie, revised 2019]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1530","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PL_MN_MNa-SA101","imgSrc":"","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Judith with the Head of Holofernes"},"objectId":964181,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Muzeum Powiatowe w Nysie","provenance":"There is no information about the provenance of the painting.
