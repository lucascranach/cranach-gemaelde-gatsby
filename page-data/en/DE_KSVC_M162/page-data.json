Coburg 2018, 94]"},"description":"The painting depicts Lucretia as a three-quarter length, standing nude figure. Her head is inclined slightly to the left and she stares into the far distance. She points the dagger at her chest with her right hand. The long dagger has already inflicted a small wound just below her breasts. She holds the hand of her left raised arm in front of her. A transparent veil is draped over Lucretia's shoulders and is blown to the right by a breeze to cover her vulva. The only jewellery she wears is an armband. Her hair is equally simple - two knots at the side with some loose strands of hair. \nAn interior is indicated in the background. On the right there is a vague indication of a red curtain and on the left there is a window through which there is a view of a wooded landscape with a river and two castles. Lucretia's overcoat, which is green and fur-trimmed lies beneath the window.\n\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 85.5 x 57.5 x 1.2 cm\n[Cat.

The panel was originally fitted in a grooved frame.\n- Dendrochronology: the following annual rings were recorde and measured: plank II: 147 annual rings, 1516-1370; plank II: 155 annual rings, 1505-1351. Generally with beech wood the entire section is used and only the bark is removed, therefore it can be estimated that the earliest felling date was 1516. The wood was then seasoned for at least two years before it could be used (Klein 2016)."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- chalk ground\n- the ground and paint layers do not extend as far as the edges of the panel ( original painted edge)"},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Framing","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- Karl Pfefferle, Munich, 1964\n[Cat.
