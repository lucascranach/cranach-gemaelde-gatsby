Her left arm is raised and with her hand she touches her hair. Her right hand is also raised, and with it she points the dagger almost horizontal between her breasts. Lucretia wears a fur-trimmed overcoat. Beneath this a transparent undergarment is visible. Her blond hair is held back with a black hair band and covered with a transparent veil. She wears numerous pieces of jewelry: two thin chains, a chain necklace, a bracelet and a ring.\nThe background is dark.\n[Herrschaft, Rabensteiner 2013]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: \n71.5 x 47.4 cm\nIncluding frame:
