Gregory stands in front of the altarpiece, which is shown from the left side in this depiction. On or above the Mensa the Man of Sorrows appears in a bluish band of clouds in which the Stations of the Cross in the form of the Arma Christi (Instruments of the Passion) are symbolically illustrated. Gregory looks up over the raised host at Christ. Two officiating priests kneel behind him and hold the braiding on his chasuble. Other celebrants and members of the congregation are also represented. A bishop descending some steps can be seen through an open door in the background.\n[cda 2016]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 86.4 x 61.9 cm (34 x 24 3/8 in.)\n[Ackland Art Museum, revised 2014]","exhibitionHistory":"Ackland Exhibitions\n13 Mar 1959 - 31 Dec 1959 Anonymous Loans\n26 Oct 1959 - 15 Dec 1959 Birth of a Museum\n27 Sep 1970 - 17 Oct 1970 Ackland Collection (1970)\n14 Jun 1986 - 24 Aug 1986 Likeness and Character: Portraits in the Ackland Art Museum\n1990 Gallery Reinstallation: Middle Ages and Northern European Renaissance\n2 Dec 1990 Gallery Reinstallation: European and 20th Century Art - newly conserved works\n13 Nov 1998 - 14 Nov 1998 A Tribute to Joseph Sloane\n17 Sep 2000 - 11 Jun 2001 Mass and Masterpiece: Celebrating the Eucharist in Renaissance and Baroque\n2 Aug 2007 - 30 Jan 2008 16th - 17th Century Art from the Permanent Collection\n30 Jan 2008 - 7 Aug 2011 Art and Religious Life in Early Modern Europe, 1400 - 1750\n24 Jun 2011 -  Permanent Collection - The Western Tradition","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3226,"height":4274}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":288},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":576},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":864},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2238,"height":3223},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":265},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":530},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":795},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3226,"height":4274},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_AAM_59-8-2","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Ackland Art Museum, revised 2014]","role":"Artist","suffix":"Circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder"}],"involvedPersonsNames":[],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > states > North Carolina > counties > Orange > inhabited places > Chapel Hill","term":"Chapel Hill","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > states > North Carolina > counties > Orange > inhabited places > Chapel Hill","term":"Chapel Hill","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Ackland Art Museum, revised 2014]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 86.4 x 61.9 cm (34 x 24 3/8 in.)\n[Ackland Art Museum, revised 2014]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1550","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"US_AAM_59-8-2","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E/01_Overall/US_AAM_59-8-2_FRSup006E_2014_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Mass of St. Gregory"},"objectId":801964,"objectName":"FRSup006E","owner":"Ackland Art Museum, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ackland Fund","provenance":"- 29.01.1914 sale Leon Hirsch, No. 46, New York\n- Ehrlich Galleries, New York\n- Long, W.
