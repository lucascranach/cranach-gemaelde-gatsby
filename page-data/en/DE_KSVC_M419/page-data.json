The youngest annual ring is from the year 1522. Generally with beech wood the entire section is used and only the bark is removed, therefore it may be assumed that 1522 is the earliest felling date. The wood would then have been seasoned for at least two years before it was used (Klein 2016)."},{"keywords":[],"kind":"Ground and Imprimatura","purpose":"Technical examination / Scientific analysis","text":"- chalk ground\n[Cat.
