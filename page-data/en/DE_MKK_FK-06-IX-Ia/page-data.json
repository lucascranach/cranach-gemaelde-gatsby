Her black embroidered dress is laced around the stomach and has a high stiff collar. She wears a pendant set with precious stones around her neck as well as numerous chains, including a double large linked chain. Her neck is concealed by a white pleated blouse and her hair is tucked under a pearl snood. The embroidery on the snood reveals various letters, two of which can be identified as 'H. W'. Her attire is completed with a black beret set at an angle and decorated with feathers.\n[Daniel Görres, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 64 x 49 cm\nDimensions including frame: 85.5 x 70.5 x 5.5 cm\n[Museum Kurhaus Kleve, revised 2018]","exhibitionHistory":"Kleve 2012, No. 5.53","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1818,"height":2369}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":261},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none_2002_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":521},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none_2002_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":782},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none_2002_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1818,"height":2369},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none_2002_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia_FR-none_2002_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"DE_MKK_FK-06-IX-Ia","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"(?)
