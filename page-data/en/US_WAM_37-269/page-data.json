Indeed, this attractive young woman in rich attire sends mixed signals. Her hair hangs loosely, so she is a not married woman, whose hair would be discretely controlled. In a formal portrait, this would indicate that she is a virgin. However, she engages the viewer directly with an unabashed gaze and an expression suggesting familiarity. This would be inappropriate for an unmarried woman of a respectable family. Her gold jewelry and velvet dress is fashionable, but she wears no high-necked blouse under it. This provocative young woman could be Mary Magdalene, often said to have been a prostitute before she met Christ. \n\n[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21924/mary-magdalene-/](accessed

This tray contains silica gel tiles.  The panel and tray fit into a Plexiglas vitrine, which is composed of 3 pieces: a side collar, front and back, taped together to form a box and screwed at the base. The box is not airtight and therefore does not form a true microclimate box. Due to the depth of the spacers and panel tray this box extends well beyond the antique frame and is contained in a 2 inch build-up that is attached to the frame reverse.  This weakens the frame and makes the painting stand 3 proud from the wall.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                \nCONDITION\n\nSUPPORT (panel):\nunsound; convex warp; weak/brittle/desiccated; losses; splits; disjoins; thinned \n\nComment:   The panel is very fragile due to having being thinned, a misaligned join and numerous splits caused by the removed cradle.  The panel is currently very thin and the wood has been further weakened by woodworm damage, especially at the right edge and wherever fixed members of the cradle were glued. No splits are mobile but the panel is extremely vulnerable.  The vitrine is not air tight.\n\nPAINT\npreviously cleaned; dislevel fills; inpainting , some of which is not a good match.\n\nSURFACE COATING \t\nglossy and streaky with matte and dull patches; surface is unsatisfactory requiring a varnish removal or local retouching and overall even coat\t\t\t\t\n                                                                                                                                                                             \nIN BRIEF THE PAINTING IS:\n- generally unsound and unfit for travel \n\nStructural condition is poor; appearance is poor\n\n[The Walters Art Museum 2000]\n\nsee also pdf for original report","processingDates":{"beginDate":"2000","endDate":"2000"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"23.

It was decided to rebuild the supportive panel tray to fit into the new frame and better support the painting.
