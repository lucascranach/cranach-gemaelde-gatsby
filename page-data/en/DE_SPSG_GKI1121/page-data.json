[…]\nThe composition is typical of late portraits of rulers by Lucas Cranach the Younger. Evident is the broad triangle, which evolved out of a critical analysis of Titian’s portraits and conveys peace and stability, and the simplicity of the costume, which befits the attire of the protestant sovereign.’\n[Elke A.
