She is wearing contemporary courtly attire, comprising of a dark velvet dress with decoratively slit sleeves, a high collar and laced at the waist. It is worn over a white blouse with gold brocade. Her hair is kept rather short with tight ringlets and is covered by a dark red broad-brimmed hat positioned at an angle on her head. In her right hand she triumphantly holds the sword with which she beheaded Holofernes. She has placed her left hand on the decapitated head, resting on a ledge in front of her. Through a window behind her a mountain landscape is visible. The panel is probably a copy after a painting from the Cranach workshop.\n[cda 2021]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 36.9 x 24.8 cm\n[Letter from H. Krug to D.
