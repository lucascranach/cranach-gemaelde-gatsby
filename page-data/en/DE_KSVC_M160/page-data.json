She looks at the viewer. In her right hand she holds a long dagger with the tip pointed towards herself. She wears nothing other than a thin transparent head veil, which she holds in front of her vulva together with her left hand. In addition she has a number of pieces of jewelry: a thin choker and two delicate chains. Her blond hair is pinned up. \n[Herrschaft, CDA 2010]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 51.2 x 34.8 x 1.2 cm \n[Cat.
