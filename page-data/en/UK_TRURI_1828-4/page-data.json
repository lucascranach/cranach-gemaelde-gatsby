In a private collection there is a panel from the Cranach workshop (FR 251A) on which an assistant has assembled different poses and parts of Cranach-like nude figures to form a group of the three graces. For this process he also employed the 'Study of three Girls' heads' now in Truro by transferring the design to the panel in actual size. However, he did not succeed in retaining the studyâ€™s vitality, so that a comparison also emphasizes a divergence in quality between the Master and his apprentice. The mouth and nose of the head on the right differ slightly from the sheet in Truro; and it is in exactly these details that a deviation from the underdrawing can be observed in the painted version. The underdrawing on the panel is closer to the oil sketch than the final painted version. It may therefore be assumed that the sketch was the archetype and is not a copy of the painting. \nThis high quality sheet was created to be used in the workshop as a template for specific subjects. Of course the heads could also be employed individually. Pattern books have belonged to workshop practice since the Middle Ages. Lucas Cranach seems to have fostered and systematized their use; as such he established an important, if not the most important prerequisite for the astonishing high level of productivity in his workshop. \n \n[Exhib.

X-radiography showed that the composition was first blocked out with three oval shapes; the heads were under-drawn with a fluid medium.
