It was not until 1505, through the administrative bodies of Freiberg and Wolkenstein, that he obtained his own small dominion in the middle of the Albertine territory governed by his brother Georg. Schloss Freiberg became his residence. He associated with artisans and miners, listened to reports of foreign warfare and had a large collection of  small arms and guns. In 1512 Heinrich married Katharina of Mecklenburg, who over the years won him over to the new doctrine. The pair employed a lutheran court chaplain and had the German mass read in the palace of Freiberg (1564). Despite the opposition of his catholic brother, the Freiberg clergy of the old faith, the bishop of Meißen and the protesting nobility Heinrich (1537) introduced the Reformation into his own territory and after the death of his brother into the rest of the Albertine territorial state acquired by him. At the same time together with his son Moritz he signed the prime contract of the Schmalkaldic league. In 1541 Heinrich died in Dresden, shortly after Moritz's appointment to co-regent. \n\n[Cat.

He wears a fur-lined robe with broad lapels and a beret with a brim covering his forehead and folded back at the sides. The main features of his face are recorded with a few distinctive lines. The light falling on the significant forms make them stand out clearly. [...] The face radiates energy and authority. The wrinkles between the eyebrows and the fixed gaze into the far distance contribute to this. The compact shape of the beret and the beard with their matching, diagonally ascending outlines make the head appear broader and more imposing. On the right side above the sitter's shoulder a mountain ridge is visible. Behind this is an expansive sky in which the hues characteristic of numerous other Cranach paintings are employed. These consist of yellow at the bottom which merges with pink and then blue. \n\n[Cat.
