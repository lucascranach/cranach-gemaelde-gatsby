Looking out at the viewer she inclines her head to the side. With both hands she supports the infant, who balances on her lap on his right leg, while holding his left leg at an angle in an almost dance-like attitude. This is as striking as the frontal position of the figure of Christ, who appears to address the viewer more directly than the Virgin. \n[Görres, cda 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 51 x 35 cm\n[Schwarz 2004, 180]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":4096,"height":5485}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":288},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":575},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":863},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3144,"height":4521},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":268},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":536},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":803},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4096,"height":5485},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/01_Overall/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":6480,"height":4776}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":148},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":296},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":444},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":6460,"height":4779},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-001.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":147},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-002-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":295},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-002-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":442},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-002-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":6480,"height":4776},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-002-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none/04_X-radiograph/F_MdLP_MNR519_FR-none_X-radiograph_Detail-002.dzi"}}]}},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"F_MdLP_MNR519","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Workshop Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2017]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":true,"name":"","nameType":"","prefix":"","remarks":"[Joconde.
