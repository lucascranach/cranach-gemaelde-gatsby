She is wearing a black gown with a stiff collar and embroidered decorative elements. A white pleated blouse with an embroidered hogh ruff collar is visible beneath. Her hair is tucked under an embroidered snood, which is covered by a black beret set at an angle and decorated with feathers. The embroidery on her collar and the band of the snood feature parts of her motto ‘Alles in Ehren’. Some small accessories complete her attire: a pendant with precious stones as well as two linked chains around her neck and various rings.\n[cda 2020]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 25 x 20 cm\n[Handwritten on the reverse of a b/w photograph; Koepplin Archive]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3936,"height":5658}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":288},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":575},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":863},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3936,"height":5658},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none/01_Overall/PRIVATE_NONE-P441_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- around the sitter's collar:\n'AL IN ER [N] // IN EREN'\n- on the band of her bonnet:\n'IN EREN'","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P441","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"with participation by Lucas Cranach the Younger [Letter from D.
