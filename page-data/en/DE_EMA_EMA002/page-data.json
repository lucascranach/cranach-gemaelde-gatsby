It is recorded that in 1746 the panel was installed in the Trinity church „unten im Gange, wenn man auf den Gottesacker geht, linker Hand\" (at the end of the corridor when walking towards the cemetery) (AK Dresden 1989, S. 142). \nThis is an epitaph painting (or rather two) executed on two separate panels for husband and wife, which were mounted together in a frame with a rounded top. Epitaph paintings were usually placed inside a church, where most are recorded. Their use in cemeteries has also been proved, even if the evidence is slight, as these panels rarely survived the extreme weather conditions. As far as can be substantiated these panels and similar examples were set into a niche in the back wall of family tombs that extended along the cemetery wall. They may also have been used for swinging doors, as some of the recorded panels are painted on both sides. (Wulf 2016, S. 83ff.).\nUnlike its pendant (CDA ID DE_EMA_EMA001) Margareta Schuman’s panel exhibits a painted text field with personal dates within the image. The deceased is named here first with her date of death, followed by the name of her husband and his date of death. At the same time the left panel shows usual epitaph representation of the deceased and her family members in the foreground. \n[Wulf 2016, Kat.nr. 03/rechts]","year":2016}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1557,"dated":"1557","end":1557,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"The painting depicts a frontal view of Christ surrounded by mothers with their little children. While already holding one of the children in his arms he touches another one who kneels with his mother in front of him. Unlike Christ the group of women on the right wear contemporary dress. At the left edge the apostle Peter appears to want to hold back further women with their children and in doing so he turns his back on a group of male spectators. The foreground is occupied by playing children.
