Differences between the panels can only be found in some details. On the panel in Jachymov the faces of the Virgin and the saints lack individual features. Both the attribute of St Margaret - a cross - and the crown held by the angels have been simplified; and finally arrangement of the folds in the draperies are different. Despite the well interpreted detail of the landscape in the background of the Jachymov panel a certain logical composition of the picture space is lacking. The artistic quality of the work in Jachymov is less accomplished compared with the Berlin panel. \n[Exhib. Cat.

References to the betrothal of St Catherine to Christ: 'Ego me Christo sponsam traditi' can be found in the Golden Legend by James de Voragine. The episode, which is rooted in the first half of the 14th century, was incorporated into the story of St Catherine in the Old Bohemian Passional (published in 1495).\nAccording to the legend the saint met a hermit who gave her a small icon of a madonna. When the saint prayed in front of it the Virgin appeared with the infant Christ and Jesus gave St Catherine a precious ring to confirm her as his bride. The ring was displayed as a precious relic in the convent of St Catherine in Sinai, where she was buried.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 86 x 62 cm\n[Exhib. Cat.
