Cranach literally spelled out this statement in the air. The mounted Roman soldier recognizes Jesus' divinity with the phrase 'Truly this man was the Son of God!' The centurion wears armor and a plumed hat fashionable in Renaissance Germany. Cranach was closely associated with Martin Luther and the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. The artist and the cleric were friends, and both lived in Wittenberg. By 1522, Luther had translated the Bible's New Testament into German so that it would be accessible to lay readers. Significantly, the words of Jesus and the centurion are here written in German, not the traditional Latin of the Catholic Church.\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46168&detail=note] (accessed 08.02.2012)","year":null},{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"'Painted in 1536, when the Protestant Reformation was well established in many regions of Germany, the National Gallery's panel and related versions have been interpreted as reflecting one of the central tenets of Lutheran doctrine, salvation through faith alone. The prominently displayed centurion may be seen as a personification of the idea that salvation is achieved through the gift of God's grace, and his conversion to Christianity as evinced by his words constitutes an individual statement of faith [1]. Talbot also noted associations between the centurion, mounted on a white charger, and Saint George, the almost archetypal Christian knight, and, further, the images of the militant Christian soldier found in Erasmus of Rotterdam's 'Enchiridion Militis Christiani' or Dürer's engraving 'Knight, Death, and the Devil'[2]. Although secondary in importance, the Good Thief may also be seen as an example of salvation through faith. Moreover, the use of the vernacular rather than the Latin in the inscriptions is in line with the Lutheran belief that the word of God should be directly accessible to all believers.\nAt the time of its exhibition in Dresden in 1899 'The Crucifixion with the Converted Centurion' was considered by Friedländer to be 'probably autograph', while Flechsig thought it was by Hans Cranach but that Lucas Cranach the Younger should be considered [3]. Subsequent authors, however, have confirmed the attribution to Lucas Cranach the Elder, and whether the panel was painted entirely by Cranach himself or contains workshop participation, the quality of execution is, in fact, quite high.\nAlthough Cranach produced numerous images of the Crucifixion throughout his career, 'The Crucifixion with the Converted Centurion' is apparently the earliest of a relatively small number of versions of this type. Closest to the National Gallery's picture, but smoother and blander in appearance, is the panel in the Staatsgalerie Aschaffenburg, which is monogrammed and dated 1539 [4]. Two other versions, each dated 1538 (Museo de Bellas Artes, Seville, [5] and Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven [6]), repeat the composition but alter details such as the pose of the Bad Thief or the costume of the centurion. Friedländer and Rosenberg list another version containing a bust-length donor portrait that in 1931 was in a private collection in Paris [7]. A close replica of the National gallery's panel is in a private collection in Basel [8].\n \n[1][Talbot 1967, 71]; [Eisler 1977, 24-25]; [Exhib.

The crucified Christ, silhouetted against a darkened and troubled sky, is at the point of death; his last words from the cross are inscribed above him in German: 'VATER IN DEIN HE[N]T BEFIL ICH MEIN GAIST' (Father, into thy hand I commend my spirit [Luke 23:46]). At that moment, a Roman centurion, astride a white charger, recognizes Christ's divinity and pronounces: 'WARLICH DISER MENSCH IST GOTES SVN GEWEST' (Truly, this man was the Son of God [Mark 15:39]).\nThe theme of 'The Crucifixion with the Converted Centurion' especially appealed to Protestants because it clearly illustrated the doctrine of salvation by faith alone, the central precept of their creed. The centurion, clothed in contemporary armor, symbolized the 'Knight of Christ' who steadfastly defends his new-won belief despite all adversity.\n\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46168] (accessed 08.02.2013)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 50.8 x 34.6 cm (20 x 13 5/8 in.) \nDimensions including frame: 67.6 x 51.7 x 5.3 cm (26 5/8 x 20 3/8 x 2 1/16 in.)\n\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46168] (accessed 08.02.2013)","exhibitionHistory":"Dresden 1899, No. 65\nPennsylvania 2007","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2077,"height":3000}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":289},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C/01_Overall/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":578},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C/01_Overall/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":867},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C/01_Overall/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2077,"height":3000},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C/01_Overall/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C/01_Overall/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"- across top: \n'VATER IN DEIN HE[N]T BEFIL ICH MEIN GAIST'\n(Father, into thy hand I commend my spirit)\n\n- at top of cross: \n'I.N.R.I'\n\n- centre, below Christ's feet: \n'WARLICH DISER MENSCH IST GOTES SVN GEWEST'\n(Truly, this man was the Son of God)","inventoryNumber":"US_NGA_1961-9-69","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46168] (accessed 08.02.2013)","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","date":"","displayOrder":4,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Flechsig 1900, 275]","role":"Artist","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Hans Cranach","date":"","displayOrder":6,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Hans Cranach","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Flechsig 1900, 275]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]},{"constituentId":"32402","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Jüngere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Younger","nameType":"Alternativer Name"}]},{"constituentId":"117281","details":[{"name":"Hans Cranach","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > districts (national) > District of Columbia > inhabited places > Washington","term":"Washington","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > districts (national) > District of Columbia > inhabited places > Washington","term":"Washington","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on beech wood\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46168&detail=tech] (accessed 08.02.2013)\n[Klein, Report 1994]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 50.8 x 34.6 cm (20 x 13 5/8 in.) \nDimensions including frame: 67.6 x 51.7 x 5.3 cm (26 5/8 x 20 3/8 x 2 1/16 in.)\n\n[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=46168] (accessed 08.02.2013)"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1536","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"US_NGA_1961-9-69","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C/01_Overall/US_NGA_1961-9-69_FR378C_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Crucifixion with the Converted Centurion"},"objectId":485357,"objectName":"FR378C","owner":"National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.
