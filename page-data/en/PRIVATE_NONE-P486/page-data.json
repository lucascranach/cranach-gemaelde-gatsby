It differs most dramatically from Cranach in the addition of a parapet, along which Christ inscribes in Latin the words TERRA TERRAM ACCUSAT.\n\n[Christie's online database, accessed 06.04.2021](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1849285)","year":2000}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1520,"dated":"about 1525","end":1530,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Emmendörffer 1997, 94] [Christie's online database, accessed 06.04.2021](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1849285)"},"description":"In the depiction of this scene from St John's Gospel (8, 1-11) the artist employs three-quarter-length figures. Christ stands at the centre of the image wearing a robe and a red cloak. He points at the inscription on the parapet with the index finger of his right hand, while linking his left hand under the right arm of the adulteress, who is standing to his left. She is shown as a young woman in contemporary dress – a brocade dress with blue sleeves – with her hair pinned up and her head bowed. She is wearing a decorative pendant around her neck set with precious stones. A group of bearded men stand at the right edge. More figures are shown at the left, one in the foreground appears to hold a pile of stones at the ready. The figurative group is arranged in what appears to be a church interior with a view of a fortress and church through an open arch. The tower of the church rises directly above Christ’s head.\n[cda 2021]\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hans_Kemmer_-_Jesus_und_die_Ehebrecherin_(Christie%27s_2000).jpg","dimensions":"Dimensions of support:  86.5 x 96 cm\n[Christie's online database, accessed 06.04.2021](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1849285)\nDimensions of support: 62.3 x 96.5 cm\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 100]","exhibitionHistory":"Norfolk, Virginia, 1973 (Chrysler Museum)","images":null,"inscription":"inscribed 'TERRA - TERRAM ACCUSAT' (upside down, on the ledge)","inventoryNumber":"PRIVATE_NONE-P486","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Hans Kemmer","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Hans Kemmer","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"[Emmendörffer 1997, 94] [Christie's online database, accessed 06.04.2021](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1849285)","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"123883","details":[{"name":"Hans Kemmer","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on oak (?) wood\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 100]\nPainting on wood\n[Christie's online database, accessed 06.04.2021](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1849285)","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support:  86.5 x 96 cm\n[Christie's online database, accessed 06.04.2021](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-1849285)\nDimensions of support: 62.3 x 96.5 cm\n[Emmendörffer 1997, 100]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"about 1525","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"PRIVATE_NONE-P486","imgSrc":"","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Christ and the Adulteress"},"objectId":1004620,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Private Collection","provenance":"- Walter P.
