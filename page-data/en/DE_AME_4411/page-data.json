(John 10, 14-15). This metaphor of the pastor is already present in Early Christian art. At a dinner speech in the Spring of 1533 Martin Luther remarked among others that 'M. Lucas depicted Christ carrying the sheep out of the desert ('M. Lucas pingat' Christum ovem e deserto humeris reportantem`, Werke 1912, 248 No. 533). Without doubt he was referring to Lucas Cranach the Elder by whom no such work is known.\nThe painting of interest here, beautifully rendered in subdued brown and grey tones, is stylistically endebted to the paternal teacher (Cranach the Elder). However the characteristic depiction of the winged serpent in the top right of the background seems to indicate that the painting is undoubtedly the work of Cranach the Younger from the 1550s (see also Schade 1974, 420f.).'\n[Michaelis, Exhib.
