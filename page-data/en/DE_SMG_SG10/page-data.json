[1] Whereas pendant pieces depicting Martin Luther have survived for the versions in Berlin, Regensburg and Dresden these are missing for both the painting in Munich and Gotha. However a portrait of the Wittenberg reformer probably originally served as the pendant to each of these paintings. Serial production of the small format portraits of Luther and Melanchthon began in 1532 and remained with regards to the portrait of Luther unaltered. Conversely from 1543 the representation of Melanchthon was modified with a pointed beard and a beret, as illustrated by the small panel in Kassel (see Cat No. 36). [2]  \nBeyond the possible function as a friendship portrait [3] the serial character of this portrait type allows an association with the current political and confessional developments: the year 1532 marked the accession to power of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous of Saxony, succeeding his father Johann the Steadfast of Saxony as elector and supporter of the reformation. Prior to this in 1530 the frontiers between the confessional factions had been further aggravated by a Lutheran confessional statement, the ‚Confessio Augustana‘, written under Melanchthon’s guidance and presented to the emperor at the Reichstag in Augsburg. This situation culminated in the formation of the protestant alliance the Schmalkaldic League. [4] The portraits could therefore have served a politically motivated propaganda of the new faith and its representatives, whose ‘image’ was to be embedded in the conscious mind through the serial character of the paintings.[5] On the other hand they can be interpreted as the indirect expression of support from the new elector for the reformist cause, and may have been gifts to like-minded rulers. [6]\nBy virtue of recent insights acquired regarding specific features of the painting in Gotha the question of a new attribution must be posed: [7] among others the specific rendition of the insignia and the addition of dots to the date links the painting with other portraits of Luther and Melanchthon as well as other thematic works from the Cranach workshop and as such relates it to works firmly attributed to Cranach’s eldest son Hans who died young. [8] Serial portraits like that of Melanchthon may have been used as an exercise for Cranach’s standardized production, while a deviation from the standard signature employed by the Cranach-workshop may have functioned as the mark of an individual assistant.
