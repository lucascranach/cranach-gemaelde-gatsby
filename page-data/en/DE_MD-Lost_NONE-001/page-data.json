However on the 7th of September, shortly before completion, the tower collapsed. Joachim and his brother Georg III decided  therefore to have a new tower built. Georg died in 1553 so it was Joachim who supervised the building of the tower, which was completed in 1554. On the 22nd of March while repairing the top of the tower the double portrait from 1553 was found together with five documents written by Melanchthon. The last of the documents was signed by Joachim on the 23rd of October1553 and concerns the building of the church and the tower. It also lists the personnel in the service of the prince and contains an outline of the Anhalt lineage. (see Hönicke 1833, 5-6; for the documents: 6-36).\n[Görres, cda 2015]","year":2015}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1553,"dated":"1553","end":1553,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"A full-length double portrait of Princes Georg III of Anhalt (left) and his brother Joachim I of Anhalt (right).

It is complemented by two coats-of-arms beneath and four either side. Georg wears a fur-trimmed gown and holds rosary beads and a book in his hands. His brother is shown in an elaborately decorated robe with fur-trimming and has gloves and a sword. \n[Görres, cda 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: unknown\n[cda
