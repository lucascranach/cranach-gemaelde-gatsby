She is wearing a dark red velvet dress with slits on the underarm over a white pleated blouse. This is visible on the sleeves and the décolleté. Around her neck she wears a ring set with pearls with a pendant and a long chain. Her brown curly hair is plaited. She wears brown gloves on her hands and holds her attribute. Above a balustrade in the background a green velvet curtain reveals an expansive landscape at the right. \n[Daniel Görres, cda 2018]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 76 x 54 cm \n[Auct. Cat.
