Jesus takes some grapes from the hands of young Saint John while three angels hold a finely wrinkled red cloth behind them, forming a sort of canopy. A landscape at the upper left of the painting recalls the artist's training in the Danube school.\n\nThis work is outstanding for its firm drawing, the predominance of line over color and the elegant play of curves, counter-curves and undulations in the characters' hair. The light dilutes some profiles and slight sfumato effects create a certain degree of melancholy in the midst of this joyous scene.\n\n[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-virgin-with-the-christ-child-saint-john-and-angels/](accessed 10.09.2012)","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 121.3 x 83.4  x 0.6 cm (thinned and cradled; coated on the reverse with a later greenish grey application) \n\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":703,"height":1024}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":291},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G_2001_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":583},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G_2001_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":874},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G_2001_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":703,"height":1024},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G_2001_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G_2001_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"ES_MNdP_P07440","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"Verso on the cradle:\n- second vertical batten,\nin blue marker: 'P7440' \n\n[cda 2013]","locations":[{"path":"España > regions > Madrid > provinces > Madrid > inhabited places > Madrid","term":"Madrid","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"España > regions > Madrid > provinces > Madrid > inhabited places > Madrid","term":"Madrid","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 121.3 x 83.4  x 0.6 cm (thinned and cradled; coated on the reverse with a later greenish grey application) \n\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1536","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"ES_MNdP_P07440","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G/01_Overall/ES_MNdP_P07440_FR228G_2001_Overall-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"The Virgin with the Christ Child, Saint John and Angels"},"objectId":541522,"objectName":"FR228G","owner":"Museo Nacional del Prado","provenance":"- Collection of Duquesa de Valencia, Madrid\n[Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, 65, No. 189i]\n- acquired 1988\n[Museo Nacional del Prado, revised 2013]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"65","referenceId":"152","title":"Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932"},{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"417","title":"Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979"}],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Museo Nacional del Prado","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[],"overallAnalysis":"see pdf\n\n- probably thinned and cradled because of extensive wood worm damage in the panel\n\n[del Carmen Garrido, Curatorial file, Museo Nacional del Prado, 1983]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"18.02.1983","endDate":"18.02.1983"},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"07.
