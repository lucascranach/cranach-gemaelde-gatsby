To this end he sent a letter to Elector August of Saxony in 1578 requesting portraits of all the dukes of Saxony the size of the enclosed piece of paper. In 1580 the Archduke expressed his gratitude for 50 portraits delivered to him (see provenance). 48 of these small portraits have been preserved, all signed with the Cranach insignia. Archduke Ferdinand probably received about 950 portraits in this way or that he commissioned himself, each measuring about 13.5 x 10 cm (see last mentioned Schütz 2002)\nAugust of Saxony commissioned Lucas Cranach the Younger with the task and paid him accordingly (Schade 1974, 451 No. 514, 452 No. 517 and No. 519, 452 No. 521). The project was not new, Friedrich the Wise already owned a series of portraits displayed in Wittenberg castle and in 1571 Elector August had commissioned a portrait series for the castle of Augustusburg. Cranach the Younger could therefore draw on workshop prototypes, which with regards to the portraits of the earliest Saxon dukes were probably based on older models. (Schütz, Exhib. Cat. Vienna 1972,  36-38)\nThe portraits by Cranach the Younger have a uniform blue background and a cast-shadow to one side of the sitter. As such they stand out from the other works in the series. Furthermore all 48 images are painted on canvas and not paper. They were later laminated onto wood and in isolated cases cardboard. The very uniform appearance of the reverse of all the portraits belonging to the series suggests that they were attached to the auxiliary support after entering the Ambras collection.
