It is one of a series of similar portraits which date from 1525 or 1526, and some of theae are accompanied by a pendant portrait of Katharina, suggesting that the present picture may also have been one of a pair. Luther's expression is restrained and calm, lending the sitter gravitas and legitimizing his marriage and his position as a leader of the European Reformation. \n[City Museum & Art Gallery, Bristol, revised 2017]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 40.4 - 40.5 x 27.2 - 27.4 cm x 0.25 (edges) - 1.0 cm (center)\n[KKL, 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"London 2008","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1250,"height":1865}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none_2007_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":597},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none_2007_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":895},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none_2007_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1250,"height":1865},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none_2007_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none/01_Overall/UK_BMAG_K1650_FR-none_2007_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"UK_BMAG_K1650","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[City Museum & Art Gallery, Bristol, revised 2017]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United Kingdom > countries > England > unitary authorities > Bristol > inhabited places > Bristol","term":"Bristol","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United Kingdom > countries > England > unitary authorities > Bristol > inhabited places > Bristol","term":"Bristol","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Exhib.
