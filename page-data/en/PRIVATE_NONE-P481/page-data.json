She is wearing contemporary courtly attire, comprising of a dress with puffed sleeves at the elbows, and laced at the waist. It is worn over a white blouse with a high collar and gold brocade. Her hair is worn up under a pearl snood. It is covered by a broad-brimmed hat positioned at an angle on her head and decorated with ostrich feathers. In her right hand she triumphantly holds the sword with which she beheaded Holofernes. She has placed her left hand on the decapitated head that rests on a ledge in front of her. The panel is probably a copy after a painting from the Cranach workshop.\n[cda 2021]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 20 x 15 cm\n[Letter from D. Koepplin to E.
