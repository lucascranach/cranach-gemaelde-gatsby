Her right arm and the hand holding the dagger are raised. The dagger is pointed at her torso. She holds the green fur-trimmed cloak in her lowered left hand. Her jewellery consists of a richly decorated neckband and a double large linked chain. Her hair is gathered under a pearl snood beneath a flat hat. The background is black. \n[Herrschaft, cda 2017]\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. Depictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century.
