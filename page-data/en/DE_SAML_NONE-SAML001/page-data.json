His facial features are relaxed, his eyes are closed and his hair and beard are accurately clipped. He is wearing a pleated shirt, his body is covered. The head rests on a high pillow with a yellow cloth cover. In front a diamond-pattern is visible on a light red ground. The bier stands in a room. There is a gilded pillar with a classical capital behind the head of the deceased, while the rest of the room is obscured by a curtain. Above the head there is a shape redolent of a medallion, which may belong to a wall painting.\n[Exhib. Cat. Lübeck 2015, 366f]\nSince the conservation treatment some of the details can be reinterpreted: the pillow is in fact white, but the yellowed varnish made it appear yellow, the pillar is wooden rather than gilded, the classical capital appears to be a profile, the 'medallion on the wall' is probably a carving on a bedstead. \n[Conservation report, Maire Müller-Andrae von Butt, conservation treatment, 2015]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 39 x 51.5 x 1.5 cm\nDimensions of epitaph: 127 x 260 x 4.2 cm\n[St. Annen-Museum, revised 2018]","exhibitionHistory":"Lübeck 2015, No. 71","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":3468,"height":1722}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":99},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":199},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3468,"height":1722},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":99},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":199},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":298},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":3468,"height":1722},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none/01_Overall/DE_SAML_NONE-SAML001_FR-none_2015_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"At the request of the town council Lübeck¿s first superintendent Hermann Bonnus was portrayed for his epitaph while he was laid out in the Sängerkapelle of the Marienkirche in February 1548. \nThe portrait got lost during the 19th century and was replaced in 1917 by this painting.
