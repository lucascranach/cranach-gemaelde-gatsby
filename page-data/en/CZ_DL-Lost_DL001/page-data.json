St Katharine kneels to his left and with his right hand he places a ring on her little finger, while with his left hand he grabs an apple offered to him by the unidentified female figure kneeling to his right. She holds a pear ready to give him in her left hand. Numerous figures are represented without haloes. The Virgin's head is quite plain, but her long wavy hair falls over her shoulders, appearing light yellow against the red background; the undergarment that leaves her neck free has linear folds and is red with blue cuffs, the lining is yellow exhibiting folds that shimmer orange. St Katharine's dress is green with a broad reddish upper band and is gathered together with a belt. Her hair is concealed beneath a net bonnet, which is decorated along the forehead with a boarder of pearls. Around her neck she wears a wide decorative band, her décolleté is concealed in white and decorated with a double coarse-meshed chain and a slim cord further up. The second saint has flowing hair tied back above the forehead with a black band, a small cross hangs from her necklace, and a second  loop of the same necklace hangs down over her bodice, that peeps out from beneath her dark red robe and is decorated with threaded pearls.\nBehind this central group three winged angels hover holding a cloth that is almost black and exhibits a reddish sheen on the reverse of the folds. Above in the clouds there are three adoring angels and ten cherubs' heads are distributed across the curved top. The ground consists of a lawn with bluebells, strawberries and the like. \n[Luksch 1920, n.p.]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 96 x 71 cm\n[Luksch 1920, n.p.]","exhibitionHistory":"","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":1274,"height":1721}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":270},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":540},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":811},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1274,"height":1721},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":270},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-001-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":540},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":811},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-001-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":1274,"height":1721},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-001-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-001.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"CZ_DL-Lost_DL001","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Luksch 1920, n.p.]","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"Painting on wood\n[Luksch 1920, n.p.]","metadata":{"additionalInfos":["Malerei","Dimensions of support: 96 x 71 cm\n[Luksch 1920, n.p.]"],"classification":"Malerei","date":"1520 - 1550","entityType":"PAINTING","id":"CZ_DL-Lost_DL001","imgSrc":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none/01_Overall/CZ_DL-Lost_DL001_FR-none_Overall-001-s.jpg","langCode":"en","subtitle":"","title":"Virgin and Child with two female saints"},"objectId":824473,"objectName":"FR-none","owner":"Diecéze litomerická (Bishopric of Litomerice)","provenance":"- according to the formly attached Latin inscription banished from a church by Lutherans from Meissen \n- in 1664 given to the first Bishop of Litomerice, Maximilian Rudolf von Schleinitz, who placed the panel in his private chapel \n- 1976 stolen, since then missing \n[Luksch 1920, n.p.]\n[E-Mail Lada Hlavackova, Diözesankonservatorin Litomerice, 17 Jul 2015]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"no pagination","referenceId":"28767","title":"Luksch 1920"}],"relatedWorks":"","repository":"Unknown","restorationSurveys":[{"filenames":[],"involvedPersons":[{"name":"Vinzenz Luksch","role":"written by"}],"overallAnalysis":"- the paint layers exhibit cracking down to the ground, the cracks appear dark and dirty\n- numerous bad retouches\n- the thin panel has been laminated to a second panel; four splits are clearly visible \n[Luksch 1920, n.p.]","processingDates":{"beginDate":"1920","endDate":""},"project":"","remarks":"","signature":{"date":"19.
