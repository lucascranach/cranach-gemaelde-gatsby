Cranach and his workshop painted dozens of versions of Lucretia's story. This painting is believed to be one of the primary versions, because-unlike many of the others-inscribed on the ledge behind the figure of Lucretia are Cranach's insignia, and, most unusual, the date of the painting's execution.\n[Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation, revised 2014]","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1529,"dated":"1529","end":1529,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated]"},"description":"The painting depicts Lucretia as a standing three-quarter length figure in contemporary dress with a view of a landscape in the background. \nHer face is inclined slightly to the right. In her right hand she holds a long dagger pointed towards herself and in her left hand she elegantly holds her overcoat. This is red and trimmed with fur and is draped over her right shoulder. Under the overcoat she wears a precious gold and black robe with stepped sleeves and a white undergarment with puffed sleeves, which is open to reveal her chest. To complement the robe Lucretia wears precious jewellery: a choker and a neckband decorated with pearls. In addition her curls are pinned up beneath a bonnet.  \nThe background is dark, but a window on the left indicates that Lucretia is standing in a room. A view of a mountainous landscape with a town and a castle is visible through the window. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 75 x 54 cm (29 ' x 21 ' inches)\n[Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation, revised 2014]","exhibitionHistory":"Royal Academy, London, 1882, no. 192.\n\nA Golden Age of Painting: Dutch, Flemish, German Paintings, Sixteenth--Seventeenth Centuries from the Collection of the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation, touring exhibition in the United States between 1980 and 1993.\n\nThe Museum of Art, Ehime, 13 April-30 May 1999\nChiba Prefectural Museum of Art, 5 June-11 July 1999\nMie Prefectural Art Museum, 17 July-22 August 1999\nFukuoka Art Museum, 28 August-3 October 1999, cat. no. 19\n\nHerbert F.
