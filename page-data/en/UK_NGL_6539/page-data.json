The double portrait of Martin Luther and Katharina von Bora, created in the Cranach workshop in 1526 (Private Collection, Hamburg, FR Nos. 189, 190) is similar in this respect. Luther like Johann the Steadfast is shown as a bust portrait in three-quarter profile on the left. His gaze is fixed on a point beyond the picture plane to the right. The depiction of Katharina von Bora exhibits similarities with Johann Friedrich. One theory which would explain this discrepancy within the diptych is that the woman who is by nature smaller and daintier would manifest greater presence if shown as a half-length figure. As the six year old Johann Friedrich is represented in place of a wife and is in reality considerably smaller than his father he is shown frontally as a half-length figure. In contrast Luther’s wife is shown in three-quarter profile, but it is apparent that both face the viewer. Bünsche and Grimm presume that in the case of the double portrait of Luther and his wife the differences are due to the fact that a portrait of the Reformer already existed. According to Dunkerton et al. a frequently used preparatory sketch served as a template for the painting of Johann the Steadfast, whereas Johann Friedrich was portrayed specifically for this painting. Bünsche and Grimm’s theory that the asymmetrical depiction relies solely on the existence of an archetype of Luther seems absurdin the light of the serial production of paintings of both Luther and his wife. Koepplin proposes the theory for the London diptych that the discrepancy may result from different authorship. However after comparison with other diptychs the aforementioned theory that the weaker one of the pair on the right was depicted as a half-length figure also seems plausible.

The diptych can be closed and is decorated along the top edge above the coats of arms and as such is in keeping with the tradition of marriage portraits. \nAssuming a strict frontal pose the fair curly headed boy is so close to the viewer that his outline is cropped on all four sides at the edge of the image. He faces the viewer directly with slightly raised eyebrows. The boy's hat is decorated with fantastic ostrich feathers and golden brooches. Decorative slits in his green overcoat reveal a red lining. In his hands he holds a small dagger. [1]\n\nThe two sitters are identified by the coats of arms on the back of the right-hand portrait. They confirm the resemblance of the sitter in the left-hand panel to portraits of Johann the Steadfast (1468-1532) Elector of Saxony, who ruled jointly with his brother Frederick the Wise (1463-1525). The right-hand panel must therefore depict his son, Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous (1503¿1554), whose mother Sophie von Mecklenburg died at his birth in 1503.\n[1][Laura Thiepold, cda

The same difference in paint texture and colour between the face and hands was apparent and so again a thin layer of probable surface dirt was left. The painting is equally well-preserved and painted with even greater speed and vigour: the corners are almost missed by the green glaze, in a gap between the twisted links of the chain no glaze was ever applied, leaving a triangle of pale green, and some of the black paint of the pentimento filling in the area between the sleeve and body barely covers the underlying green.\nFor the treatment of the frame see NG 6538. The disruption in the centre of the upper edge was found to be caused by an old and possibly original nail and so it was decided not to attempt its removal.\nThe restoration was carried out in the same way and using the same materials as NG 6538.

In the opaque underpaint it is mixed with lead white and lead-tin yellow, while in the final translucent layers it is used alone. Very similar green paint mixtures were used for the main colour of the costume of Johann Friedrich (NG6539). The intense red strips on the boy’s costume consist of vermilion of exceptional quality and the same pigment combined with red earth and black makes up the more brownish-red stripes. There are pale yellow highlights of lead-tin yellow on the gold chain. The basic pale pink tone of the flesh paint is a mixture of white and a little vermilion, with some black pigment in addition in the shadows.\nPainting technique \nIn common with many pictures by Cranach the flesh is thinly painted. Details such as the twisted braids decorating Johann the Steadfast’s hat have been skilfully painted, with rapidly applied touches for the pearls and impasto yellow highlights for the gold, for example for the threads at the end, where the lighter green underpaint has been deliberately left exposed around them to indicate the overall shape of the tuft at the top right of the hat.

The profiles, with their simple deep scotia moulding and raised outer edge enriched with a narrow half round, are similar to those found on other frames of works by Cranach of this period.[1] They are joined with a double mortise and tenon joint.[2] It can be seen in X-ray images that neither frame fits the panel exactly: there are gaps top and bottom, although the frames fit tightly on the left and right; however, this can be explained by the natural contraction across the grain of the panels, and is not any indication that the portraits were not originally in these frames.\nThe outer edges and the backs of the frames are painted black. The inner mouldings were originally gilded although what is now visible is mainly the golden-yellow oil mordant (adhesive) [3], and only fragments of the gold leaf remain. Traces of this mordant pass beneath the black background on NG6539 confirming that it is original and was already in place when the background was painted. On NG6538 there are traces of the original final translucent green paint of the background on the gold, indicating that it was applied when the frames were complete. However, painting of the portraits and decoration of the frames were probably carried out concurrently, since there are also traces of gold from the frame on top of the black background of NG6539 at the left edge The frames are joined with iron hinges and handmade iron nails; this was done after gilding as the tips of the nails are visible in the mouldings.[4]\n[1] [Koepplin 1974]; [Heydenreich 2007 A, 76–9]\n[2] [Heydenreich 2007 A, 76]\n[3] FTIR analysis suggested that the binding medium of the mordant is oil.\n[4] Ibid., p. 78; fig. 60, p. 80, shows the hinge.\n[Susan Foister, ‘Lucas Cranach the Elder, Portrait of Johann the Steadfast and Portrait of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous’ published online 2015, from 'The German Paintings before 1800', London: forthcoming.\nwww.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/lucas-cranach-the-elder-portraits-of-johann-the-steadfast-and-johann-friedrich-the-magnanimous]"}],"type":"ArtTechExamination"}],"secondaryReferences":[],"signature":"Dated on the right side, upper section: '1509'; in yellow paint","sortingNumber":"1509-002","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"42.00","width":"0.00"},"titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Portrait of Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous from Diptych: Two Electors of Saxony","type":"Titel"}],"representativeImage":{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":128},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6539_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6539_FR019_Overall-002-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":255},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6539_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6539_FR019_Overall-002-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":383},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6539_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6539_FR019_Overall-002-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":4253,"height":2714},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6539_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6539_FR019_Overall-002-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/UK_NGL_6539_FR019/01_Overall/UK_NGL_6539_FR019_Overall-002.dzi"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
