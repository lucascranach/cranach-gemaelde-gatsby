Her head is turned slightly to the left of the painting, but she looks directly at the viewer. In her right hand she holds a long dagger pointed at her chest. Her left hand rests in her lap. Lucretia wears a fur-trimmed cloak over a contemporary dress, the sleeves horizontally and exhibit decorative slits that reveal her white undergarment. The folds of a curtain are faintly indicated in the background. \nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. Depictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century.
