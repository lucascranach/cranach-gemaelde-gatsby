H. Zimmermann pointed out the striking correspondence between the Chicago work and a watercolour drawing of Magdalena (1507 – 1534), daughter of Duke George the Bearded of Saxony and wife of Joachim of Brandenburg (1505 – 1571). The drawing is included in a manuscript geneaology of Saxon princes in the Sächsische Landesbibliothek, Dresden, executed in the Cranach workshop; it shows the figure in reverse in order to pair the princess with her sister Christina. The broad beret atop her neatly coiffed hair, heavy ermine-collared robe, puffed sleeves, and gold chains are repeated in the drawing, as is the placement of the hands, although the figure has been extended to full length to suit the format of the series. The form of the Brandenburg arms on the signet ring worn by the male stter in the Philadelphia portrait would also be appropriate for Joachim, who succeeded his father as Elector of Brandenburg in 1535, shortly after the death of Magdalena.\nSee [Cat.Chicago 2008, 352] for further discussion","year":2008}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1524,"dated":"about 1529","end":1534,"historicEventInformations":[{"begin":"1524","end":"1534","eventType":"DATING","remarks":"Signed and dated [?] [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1979, No. 327]","text":"1529"}],"remarks":"[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/87760?search_no=9&index=1] (accessed 24.09.2012)"},"description":"Portrait of a richly dressed noblewoman.","dimensions":"Dimensions of support: 59.8 x 41.6 cm (23 9/16 x 16 3/8 in.)\nDimensions of the painted surface: 59.8 x 40.6 cm (23 9/16 x 16 in.)\n[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/87760?search_no=9&index=1] (accessed 24.09.2012)","exhibitionHistory":"San Francisco 1920, No. 56 (as Sibille of Cleve)\nChicago 1952, Lackritz Jewelers (no catalogue)","images":{"overall":{"infos":{"maxDimensions":{"width":2091,"height":2953}},"images":[{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":282},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":565},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":847},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2091,"height":2953},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall.dzi"}},{"xsmall":{"dimensions":{"width":200,"height":282},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-xs.jpg"},"small":{"dimensions":{"width":400,"height":565},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-s.jpg"},"medium":{"dimensions":{"width":600,"height":847},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-m.jpg"},"origin":{"dimensions":{"width":2091,"height":2953},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall-origin.jpg"},"tiles":{"dimensions":{"width":0,"height":0},"src":"https://lucascranach.org/imageserver-2021/US_artic_1938-310_FR327/01_Overall/US_artic_1938-310_FR327_Overall.dzi"}}]},"detail":null,"reverse":null,"analysis":null,"conservation":null,"irr":null,"koe":null,"other":null,"photomicrograph":null,"rkd":null,"uv_light":null,"x_radiograph":null},"inscription":"","inventoryNumber":"US_artic_1938-310","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","displayOrder":2,"isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/87760?search_no=9&index=1] (accessed 24.09.2012)","role":"Artist","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"isBestOf":false,"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"United States > states > Illinois > counties > Cook > inhabited places > Chicago","term":"Chicago","type":"Location Cranach Object"},{"path":"United States > states > Illinois > counties > Cook > inhabited places > Chicago","term":"Chicago","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Painting on beech wood\n[Cat.
