{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-real-object-page-jsx","path":"/en/DE_DSN_NONE-DSN001","result":{"pageContext":{"additionalTextInformation":[{"author":"","date":"","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","text":"The depiction is derived from Dürer’s woodcut from the ‚Kleinen Holzschnittpassion‘ (1511). The low-angle view of the scene with a stone arch, steps and open timberwork come from there, the figure of the Virgin also draws essentially on Dürer’s version. Mirror-imaged references and the separation of some elements (like the arch and the steps) do not contradict this. […]\nThe wooden post that emerges next to Joseph, as well as the angle of the wooden beams above, recall the ‘Adoration of the Magi’ in Gotha. Of the depictions of the Virgin the painting in Copenhagen [Friedländer, Rosenberg 1932, 38, No. 44] is closest to the Naumburg picture. \nThe biblical description only affects the scene with the words ‚pannus‘, which Luther translated as ‚swaddling‘ and ‚praesepium‘ which can be interpreted as either ‚manger‘ or ‚stable‘. Ox and ass, as well as the view of the town are part of the standard repertoire for the nativity scene, whereas the cloth held by the angels is unusual. This appears to be a reference to Christ’s shroud as brilliantly depicted in a woodcut by Hans Baldung Grien.[…] \nThe squat proportions of the figures and the shape of the shepherds‘ collars as well as the movement of the angel to the right of Christ’s head – he braces his foot against the edge of the vault – have analogies in Cranach’s woodcuts from the year 1509. The painting could be from this period. […]\nOriginally it would have stood on a Lady altar. Therefore the author’s earlier assumption that it is related to the two wing panels in Dessau, Anhaltische Gemäldegalerie is improbable.[…]\nIt may seem irrelevant that the main features of the Naumburg painting appear on a signed late work of exceptional detailed execution (Auction catalogue Fischer, Luzern, 2.12.1993, 84f., No. 2155). The delegation of shepherds appears in the middle-ground, complemented by an annunciation in the distance. The group of angels around the child has vanished. The Lutheran perspective has asserted itself in this painting, therefore the Virgin is shown without a halo and the angels remain in the sky. Only the ox and ass together with the Virgin and Joseph are in close proximity of the new born child, who lying naked in a stone trough appears in seemingly grotesque isolation. The dating by Dieter Koepplin of  ‚about 1550‘ is accurate. The execution, particularly with respect to the adjustments in relation to the earlier version, suggests the authorship of Lucas Cranach the Younger. \n \n \n[Schade, in Kunde 2006, 125, 126, 127, 128]","year":2006}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1510,"dated":"about 1510 - 1515","end":1515,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Domstift Naumburg, revised 2014]"},"description":"The infant Christ is carried by angels on a white cloth. He turns towards his mother with open eyes and a raised hand. The bundle of straw brought by Joseph has not yet been spread out. A second group of angels, also four in number, appears in a cloud in an opening in the timberwork and accompanies the birth with song. Two shepherds look down from the loft as if in abreviated prayer. One of them, dark and spellbound by events, wears a yellow hood, the other, older one, has a cap in his hands. Surprisingly the view from the stable does not show the annunciation in the night, but the city gates by day.  With dedication areas of crumbling plaster are repeatedly painted on the stonework and even plaited beards and cobwebs are indicated.\nThe round faced Virgin bends over the manger with her hands held in an attitude of prayer.
