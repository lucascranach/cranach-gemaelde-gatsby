For the painterly execution of the wings the sculptor secured the cooperation of the best available artists. The exterior sides are decorated with scenes from the legend of Kunigunde by an unknown master. The first transition of the altar is of a good painterly quality by the workshops of the Master of the Döbelner Altarpiece and the workshop of the Master of the Oberbobritzsch Altarpiece which in terms of style and forms corresponds with that of the beginning of the Renaissance in Freiberg. Numerous artists working on the panels have brought together something of Cranach's world view, the Franconian culture of painting and forms common to Freiberg.\nThe interior reveals a central shrine by the workshop of Philipp Koch with a sculptural representation of the patron St Kunigunde and her husband Heinrich II flanked by the Virgin and Child with St Anne and the apostle Thomas. Scenes from the Passion of Christ are arranged either side of the shrine. \n[see: Sandner 1993, 140-143] (Translation, cda 2016)","year":null}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[],"classification":{"classification":"Malerei"},"dating":{"begin":1513,"dated":"1513","end":1513,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[Corpus dated on reverse]"},"description":"The cult of these saints has its origin in Franken and they are called upon for help in different states of distress.

On the left wing saints Catherine, Barbara and Margaret are shown in a group with the Virgin and child, otherwise known as 'virgo inter virgines'. The infant Christ at the centre puts a ring on Catherine's finger, alluding to her mystical
